# kurianbenoy-website

This is the repository for Kurian Benoy Professional website. Right now it's build using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/about.html)
and is hosted in github pages.

I have been writing in this repository October 11, 2017 and has been a home to my personal blogpost for a long time now. I did a
lot of migration of website technologies over the period of years and this now houses my previous [Machine learning blogs](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/ml-blog) as well.
