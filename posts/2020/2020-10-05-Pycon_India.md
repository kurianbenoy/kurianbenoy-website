title: Pycon India 2020 Highlights

---

Pycon India is one of the conferences which I like to attend every year. The reason is something deeply emotional because Python is the language which hooked me into programming, my first major talk was in Pycon India 2019 and I enjoy the pycon vibe every year. This was my third year attending Pycon and this time it was fully remote.

The sessions were well organised virtually using Hoppin Platform. Attending the session was very seamless in my opinion. I attended a few interesting Keynotes, talk sessions from reputed speakers. Every year, I still understand there is a lot for me to continue learning and keep hustling. Also, like every year, I attended the staircase meetings of Dgplug in Pycon India.

This year, I attended the workshop sessions as well for the first time. I attended workshops about Python for Computation Social science by Bhargav Srinivasa and Animating Data in PowerPoint by S Anand. The sessions were great and learned some interesting ideas.

I would like to sign off by thanking all the organisers of Pycon India and a special shout out to Sayan Chaudhary(Chair) for making it extra special like every year.
