## July 4

- I attended another session of Adithya Mitra mandal course to improve my communication and leadership skills. Aditya
  reviewed my resume and further shared a lot of points to improve.
- Some of the insights after program are:
a) Improving my resume and filing my gaps in Linkedin & twitter bio.
b) Aditya recommends a lot of things on how to interact in industry, hiring manager etc.
c) He gave tonnes of resources regarding books to buy, insights from some important books, apps to use and even a weekly workout schedule etc. He tells to get better every day
d) The community and mentoring will remain even after the course is completed.
