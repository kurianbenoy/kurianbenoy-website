I have been staying in Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Kottayam for
the past three days in order to partake in my 4th semester M.Tech exams. I absolutely loved my stay 
in campus.

 During my stay I had some interesting conversations with faculties, students
who are doing PHD, UG and my fellow professional classmates who are pursuing MTech program.
Some of these conversations were around latest advances of AI, AI hype etc.

The campus boasts excellent amenities. I am thankful to all the warm smiles and kindness received from everyone in campus specifically the ex-jawans who are working there.
