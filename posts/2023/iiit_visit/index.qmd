I have been staying in Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Kottayam for
the past three days to attend my 4th semester exams in M.Tech. I absolutely loved my stay 
in campus. During my stay I had some interesting conversations with facilities, students
who are doing PHD, UG and my fellow professional classmates who are pursuing MTech program.
Some of these conversations were around latest advances of AI, the works they are doing in
and how people learn things in this field. The campus is great and facilities are really good. I am 
also thankful to all the smiles and kindness received from everyone in campus specifically the 
ex-jawans who are posted there.
