## Everything is about to change

There has been a lot of buzz about GPT and ChatGPT in specific. Tom Scott,
a youtuber recently published a video on how he used ChatGPT to fix a problem
in his email backup program. He said it's beginning of something new like
how internet had literally changed everything 20-30 years back.

When I was writing this article, I forget the syntax of how to embed youtube videos in quarto
markdown. I solved this issue by asking this [question to  Quarto Help Bot](https://quarto-bot.onrender.com/) which was made by [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev/).

I have seen chatbots, yet the way ChatGPT interacts and communicates is insane to be
honest. You can ask it literally anything and these Large Language models are becoming incredibly
useful. Hamel had used [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/) which is like
a framework for building applications with LLMs specifically for quarto.

## How has the AI landscape been going in the past one year?

Personally I have been following ML/AI for the past five years atleast. Last
year really was hyped up. Initially there was this releases in DALL-E and it's
open source alternative Craiyon(then named DALLE mini) being viral. During this
time so many trending things like Stable Diffusion, Whisper etc came.

One month back, I started seeing my cousins, parents etc. discussing about
ChatGPT and how awesome it is. Some of the application apps like [Roamaround.ai](https://www.roamaround.io)
build on top of ChatGPT was being used. The final nail was last Sunday, when my grandfather called
me to read about ChatGPT article in news.

I have seen people get hyped up about advances in ML. Yet I have never heard about the 
new technology being discussed by my family member like this. Hamel Hussein put this really well in his tweet about 
what is different in this wave of ML advances.

The GPT-4 model was released by OpenAI today IST. It's been a hectic week already TBH, with
so many releases already.

## How can we try GPT-4 now?

According to OpenAI, you can try the latest GPT-4 via Chat GPT Plus Membership.

Two more options seems to be available for normal users without mulimodal search:

1. BingGPT
2. Poe App from Quora

## Is BingGPT really using  GPT-4?

To be honest, at the moment we can't be really sure about that. Even though as
Microsoft [Bing team confirmed today that they are using GPT-4](https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4).

In lot of user tests, it doesn't really seem to be the same. I tested a trick question:

> Which is heavier, two pounds of brick or one pound of feathers?

GPT-4 seems to give the correct answer at time of writing.

{{< tweet user=charles_irl id=1635699547023482880 >}}

Bing-GPT seems to give wrong answer.

{{< tweet user=kurianbenoy2 id=1636066002843627523 >}}

Chat-GPT seems to now give correct answer, it was previously giving wrong answer.

{{< tweet user=1littlecoder id=1636069386699022336 >}}

Charles seems to have come with an explaination to this problem, at the time I was writing this article.

*"GPT-4" is really a series of models, and the one live in chat now is likely the 0314 checkpoint available via the API. BingChat can't've launched with that checkpoint and likely has branched off in the intervening weeks."*
