## About Podcast interview

I recently stumbled upon a podcast interview with Jeremy Howard hosted by one
of my fast.ai friends Alex Strick van Linschoten, around 4 years back. I am
a big fan of interview featuring Jeremy and some unique question were asked by the interviewer.

I would defenitely recommend everyone to [give a watch to the podcast interview](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/2019/6/28/sources-and-methods-44-deep-learning-with-fastais-jeremy-howard). In this interview,
Jeremy shared four super powers which he learned over the years. I am going to briefly summarize
them.

## Four super powers

1. Spaced Repetition and learning how to learn

2. Doing Regular exercises

Ten years back Jeremy suffered a injury because of which he lost almost 6 months.
After that he is doing regular yoga and exercises.

3. Note taking

Lot of times Jeremy have seen whenever someone is discussing about a particular topic,
or issue. Those who take the notes on the topic immediately are the one to follow
up even later and perform much better. Exceptional people take a lot of notes. Less exceptional people assume they’re going to remember. 

Taking notes in class is kind of a waste of time. I don’t really see the point of going to class most of the time honestly, it’s probably being videotaped

4. Tenacity

People who are successful practitioners in deep learning are the ones who have
highest level of tenacity. He has found lot of people stopping midway and people
who are world-class practitioners are always tenatious.

## Two critical skills in AI era

The two critical skills going forward is:

- One is knowing how to use machine learning. 
- And the other is knowing how to interact with and care for human beings.

Because the latter one can’t be replaced by AI. The former one will gradually replace everything.

Thanks to [Alex Strick van Linschoten](forums.fast.ai/u/strickvl/) who posted it in fast.ai forums and for writing [wonderful
