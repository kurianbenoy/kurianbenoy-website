During the FOSSASIA Summit 2023, I was given an unique opportunity to introduce
speakers in Database track on morning Session of Day 2 by Hong Phuc Dang who is the FOSSASIA co-founder. I was very excited to do this
as I was doing this responsibility for the first time. I prepared a small introduction
for all the speakers and introduced them with location they are coming from.

There were speakers from Singapore, Malaysia, Russia, Taiwan etc. I was delighted to meet them in person.
Speakers from one company named Oracle were from different locations like Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan etc. Since this company had most no of speakers, I got a chance to interact with 
developers working there.

[Talk about my experience interviewing for Oracle previously, person who smiled at me and served delicious food]

[Now I make a living working in AI and I have spoken in International conferences like FOSSASIA as an expert in my field. Looking back it was pretty lucky for me.

Failed lot of interviews in my campus placement time. Almost 25 interviews I got just one job offer.
