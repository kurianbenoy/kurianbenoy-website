## Talk in 30 seconds

I talked about Malayalam language and what makes it hard to work compared to other high resource languages like English. Then I highlighted some of the Malayalam models build during Whisper event and why I went ahead to benchmark these models. These models where benchmarked on two datasets mainly Common Voice and Malayalam Speech Corpus. I also shared more about the [Vegam Whisper model family](https://huggingface.co/models?other=vegam) for making whisper models faster. Also I shared about Malayalam speech to text demo [Pallakku](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kurianbenoy/Pallakku) which I am developing now with Vegam whisper weights.
