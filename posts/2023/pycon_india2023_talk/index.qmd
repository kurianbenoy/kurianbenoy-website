## Talk in 30 seconds

I talked about what is OpenAI whisper and some of it's amazing feature. I highlighted the
importance of fine-tuning Whisper in low-resource language like Malayalam which is able to get
almost 90% accuracy compared to -10% accuracy of OpenAI whisper model weights. The results where
calculated with a new github project called [malayalam_asr_benchmarking created by me](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/malayalam_asr_benchmarking).
