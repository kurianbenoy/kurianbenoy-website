## Questions received

1. Why is Malayalam more complex than other languages like Malayalam, I understand your method of comparing TTR. Yet isn't the method of comparing TTR with other languages absurd as the data used for comparission in the dataset might not have all words of a particular language?
2. Do you think whether just a privileged few people can do Machine Learning?
3. What do you think about Mojo, will it help in reducing the problem of few privileged people doing ML?
4. How much resources is required to fine tune Whisper models?
5. How much did it cost for you to do benchmarking in Malayalam?
6. Does it really cost $30 to buy a biriyani for a family in Singapore?
7. I absoluted loved `whisper.cpp` because it's able to provide timestamps as well, is it possible to implement timestamps in Malayalam as well?
