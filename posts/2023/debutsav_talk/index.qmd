## Questions received

1. Why is Malayalam more complex than other languages like Hindi, Marathi etc. I understand your method of comparing TTR. Yet isn't the method of comparing TTR with other languages absurd as the data used for comparission in the dataset might not have all words of a particular language?
2. Do you think whether just a privileged few people can do Machine Learning?
3. What do you think about Mojo, will it help in reducing the problem of few privileged people doing ML?
4. How much resources is required to fine tune Whisper models?
5. How much did it cost for you to do benchmarking in Malayalam?
6. Does it really cost $30 to buy a biriyani for a family in Singapore? (Sorry that during the talk, I mentioned it cost $30 to buy one biriyani in Singapore which might not be quite true. This analogy was done in order to compare cost of benchmarking models for Malayalam.)
7. I absoluted loved `whisper.cpp` because it's able to provide timestamps as well, is it possible to implement timestamps in Malayalam as well?
8. What are your thoughts on LLM finetuning?

## Thanks to

All the folks who asked questions and made the session interactive, a big thank you from my side.
As a speaker, it was the first time I was satisfied with myself for making the session
interactive. My session demanded an interactive session as my slot was just after having a
delicious lunch of biriyani. Also a special thanks to the volunteer who distributed the chocolotes to folks
who answered my quiz questions. The organizers of event were fabulous, a special mention
to names of people I remember at time of writing. Thank you Jithin, Karthik, Alaka, Theerthana, Aneeta who
was always there to help regarding anything.
