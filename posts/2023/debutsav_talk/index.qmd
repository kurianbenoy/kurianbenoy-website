## Questions received

1. Why is Malayalam more complex than other languages like Malayalam. Is the method of comparing TTR with other languages absurd as
all the data of a language might not be present?
2. Do you think whether just a privileged few people can do Machine Learning?
3. What do you think about Mojo?
4. How much resources is required to fine tune Whisper models?
5. How much did it cost for you to do benchmarking in Malayalam?
