I recently went for a bird watching adventure in [Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim_Ali_Bird_Sanctuary), Thattekad Kerala, India. During that time, my guide was very proficient in identifying birds by just hearing sounds. In Salim Ali bird sanctuary itself there are almost 300 species of land birds and another 100+ species of water birds.

I was genuinely curious, how they learned about all these birds and memorized all these. This is when my guide talked about the Merlin app, which can help in learning more about various species of bird.
