I was supposed to write something before this article. Yet I stopped that and thought about writing an appreciating post to my Gym trainer Rahul. During my work-out session at the GYM, one day my
trainer said Kurian your Calf(which is muscle in our legs) is excellent. Lot of people train very hard to achieve it, yet he said he hasn't seen anyone with excellent Calfs like mine.

I believe in this famous quote from Servantetes:

> Journey is the inn

I believe life is not one dimensional and being good in just one thing means nothing. Yet
there are some dimensions like Weight loss which is not immediately in our control even when I try
to follow my workout routine atleast 5 times a week.

Young folks like Rahul who showed great dedication to his profession and most importantly not doing
body shaming ever in the GYM. In fact I really appreciate his compliment and I am grateful that there are young people  Rahul who are there in my place.
