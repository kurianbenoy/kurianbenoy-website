## Talk in 30 seconds

I talked about what is OpenAI whisper and some of it's amazing feature. I highlighted the
importance of finetuning Whisper in low-resource language like Malayalam which is able to get
almost 90% accuracy compared to -10% accuracy of OpenAI whisper model weights. The results where
calculated with a new github project called [malayalam_asr_benchmarking created by me](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/malayalam_asr_benchmarking).


## Thanks to

In my talk I mentioned [the following people and organizations](https://kurianbenoy.com/talks/fossasia2023.html#/thanks-to). Beyond that first of all, I would like to thank FOSSASIA team for giving me this opportunity to talk in FOSSASIA Summit 2023. I would like to thank [Abhijit PA](https://abhijithpa.me/) for taking pictures of my talk and Thorsen for moderating my session.

## Questions received

1. Someone was curious to know the relationship between Malayalam language
and the Sanskrit language. I told him that Malayalam is a Dravidian language and there is another class called Devanagiri languages which according to my knowledge is originated from Sanskrit.
