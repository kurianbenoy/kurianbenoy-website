I was working on Malayalam Speech to text models and the malayalam letters where not rendered
properly.

1. Installing with firefox plugins
2. Installing with Windows microsoft

I am glad to have friends like [Santhosh Thottingal](https://thottingal.in/) to ask questions like this. Santhosh has written lot of popular fonts like Manjari,
Gayathri and with his latest font Nupuram he has created almost 100+ fonts.  This is the second time
I am disappointing my friends in a while. The other one was sitting in a debian booth in open source 
conference with a laptop not having debian installed.
