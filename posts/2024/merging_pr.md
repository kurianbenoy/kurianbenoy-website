## My first commit

I was trying to find my first git/github commit with this [webapp](https://firstcommit.is). You can also find what is your commit checking that website
and [first PR with this website](https://firstpr.me/).

This first commit was for my lab programs in C- Programming Language Labs during my BTech classes at Govt. Model Engineering College. You might have wondered why I might have pushed it in github? It was all thanks to my professor Bijumon sir, who recommended this way to get started working with git/github.

## After 7 years

Today only I noticed a troll PR, send by my good friend [Jimmy Jose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/discover-jimmy/) who is now a Senior 
Devops Engineer in Esper. He recently married and I went to attend the function. It was cool to notice he [send a PR with comment wow](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/Lab-Cycle1-C-programming/pull/1) 7 years back. You should have reminded me early bro. I am all for trolls and merged it.

Thanks you Jimmy for your valuable contribution to my first github repository. It took some time to merge. Sorry bro.
