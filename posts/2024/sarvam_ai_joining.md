I'm really excited to share with all of you that I have joined as an ML engineer at Sarvam AI today to build full-stack GenAI applications for Indian languages. I would like to first of all thank my parents (Benoy K Kuriakose and Dr. Anu Thomas), my sister and grandmother. You were there with me in all my ups and downs. I am really happy to make you proud.



Secondly, I have to thank the people who got me interested in Malayalam computing. Santhosh Thottingal in his keynote at MEC.Conf in 2019, told us why working in Malayalam language is so valuable. Lot of people have helped and encouraged me to work in Malayalam language namely Dr. Kavya Manohar, Santhosh Thottingal, Dr. Manu Madhavan and Dr. Alex Strick van Linschoten. Members of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing was a constant suppport.



A big thanks to my ML Guruji Jeremy Howard (fast.ai courses where so great), members of various communities I was involved like FOSS, Python etc. Similarly I am pursuing my master from IIIT Kottayam, my bachelors was from Govt Model Engineering College and I studied my school at St Peters. The list of teachers and folks who helped me in every place is immense, so not naming everyone.  And last but not least, I would like to thank Almighty God for his grand plans for me.



Also I am really thankful for the trust founders of Sarvam.ai Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar put in me to join their organization. Also special shout out to Saurabh Karn and Abhigyan Raman for make the whole interview process so special.
