I have been wanting to get back to blogging for a while. It's been really hard to do that now but someone
inspired me so much to write something even for the sake of writing. Someone in fast.ai community who
has been following my work for a while, once asked me to write about my coding journey sometime in start of 
May after I joined Sarvam.ai. Personally I didn't want to do that, as I felt my journey is something which is
ongoing rather than something which has been achieved.

Yet recently [Simrat Hanspal](), who is a GenAI leader at Hasura reached out to me and asked me to give a
talk in Codebloosom evet. Simrat was my mentor at our [IndicSubtitler](indicsubtitler.in) and helped us with
ideas when we where starting to build. One of the girls whom she was mentoring told her about our open-source project
and she want to share  my experience. I gave a very bold title for my talk and titled as
 Why having good taste is all you need to build great open-source projects.

This blogpost is a written excrept of my coding journey which I shared there.
