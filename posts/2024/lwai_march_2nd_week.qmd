🗓️ Monday:

The Government of India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY) made an announcement regarding the deployment of ML models in production. While it was initially interpreted as a requirement for all, they clarified that it applies mainly to large organizations and not startups or Indie Hackers. This topic is still in the early stages of discussion, and we can expect further regulation in the future.
