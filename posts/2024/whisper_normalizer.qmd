Last year March, I created a python package called whisper_normalizer package with nbdev. I realized it was not possible to use the normalization algorithms in OpenAI Whisper paper either without downloading OpenAI whisper repo or using transformers package. So I created this package to use in my malayalam ASR benchmarking project.



It's incredible to see its adoption grow, with over 1000 monthly downloads via PyPI. Thrilled to witness it being used in open-source projects like Amazon OD3 and Whisper Speech. I recently exapanded to Indic languages due to a bug.



Thanks to support of Kavya Manohar, some improvements where made in Malayalam Normalization algorithm, while rest of Indic languages where using normalization algorithms borrowed from indic-nlp-library built by Anoop Kunchukuttan. Checkout the first comment for project URL.
