My last working day at Sentient.io was in the past week. It was a great experience working in an AI-based company for over 2 years now  and being part of building a lot of cool projects for large reputed clients clients of Sentient.io. 

I was working in the awesome science & research(SnR) team with members like Weina Du, Qiao Zhang, Jian Hui, Eugene Lee, CHANDRA SEKAR A and Shreya Kishore. I am grateful for some of the ex SnR members like Keng-Teck Ma, Divya Dilip and Clement Tee who helped me a lot and guided me.

I had good rapport with everyone in Sentient.io from Christopher Yeo, Eddie LEONG, CFA, Linda Su Ling Tan, Gloria Koh, Priya Somasundaram , Cedrick Tay ,Aalind Singh, Michael Ng, Mani, Karunakar Vanama, Ramesh.

I really enjoyed my time there and now it's a time to bid good bye. I even got an opportunity to visit the Sentient.io Singapore office and have a lunch with the team, when I went to speak in FOSSASIA Summit, Singapore last year. Qiao Zhang and Solomon Sim (sentient.io alum) are in the selfie with me.
