My last working day at Sentient.io was in the past week. It was a great experience working in an AI-based company for over 2 years now  and being part of building a lot of cool projects for large reputed clients clients of Sentient.io. 

I was working in the awesome science & research(SnR) team with members like [Weina Du](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weinadu/), [Zhang Qiao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zqthedesigner/), Jian Hui, [Eugene Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-lee-7284315/), [Chandra Sekar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrasekar01/) and [Shreya Kishore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-kishore-624a17190/). I am grateful for some of the ex SnR members like Keng-Teck Ma, Divya Dilip and Clement Tee who helped me a lot and guided me.

I had good rapport with everyone in Sentient.io from Christopher Yeo, Eddie LEONG, CFA, Linda Su Ling Tan, Gloria Koh, Priya Somasundaram , Cedrick Tay ,Aalind Singh, Michael Ng, Mani, Karunakar Vanama, Ramesh.

I really enjoyed my time there and now it's a time to bid good bye. I even got an opportunity to visit the Sentient.io Singapore office and have a lunch with the team, when I went to speak in FOSSASIA Summit, Singapore last year. Zhang Qiao and Solomon Sim (sentient.io alum) are in the selfie with me.

I enjoyed working in a startup. Yet it's not everyone's cup of tea, I will ask you think twice before joining any startup. In Sentient.io, I saw both the positive's and negatives of working in a startup. It was a roller-coaster ride, yet there is one good reason why you should consider joining a startup.

You learn a ton of things, get engaged in lot of projects. So if you prioritize learning in your career, Kurian would recommend joining a startup. [Chip in her article '7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html)' [^1] said:

> I once read somewhere that joining startups is the only way to get 15 years of experience in 5 years. I couldnâ€™t agree more.
