3. Researchers have introduced a ‚ÄòMind Wipe‚Äô technique for erasing hazardous knowledge from AI systems, ensuring functionality remains while enhancing safety. Alongside, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (#WMDP) benchmark, with 4,157 questions targeting biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security, has been made public.

üóìÔ∏è Saturday:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Apple announces the paper MM1 - Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training. They discuss how to build good performance multi-modal LLMs which means LLMs would be able to see, speak etc. in future beyond what it's now already doing well that is reading and writing.

2. Shaheen Gemma 7B, a model being finetuned on Urdu Alpaca dataset. It's great to see more fine-tuned LLMs in all regional languages in India. Lot of folks are putting effort in bringing my mothertongue language to fore in realm of Generative models.

3. Anwesha Sen wrote a very well written blog post about the previous AI advisory by govt of India and talk about it's vague clauses, terms which was like a stepping back into license raj.
