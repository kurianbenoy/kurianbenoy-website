🗓️ Saturday:

1️⃣ Apple announces the paper MM1 - Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training. They discuss how to build good performance multi-modal LLMs which means LLMs would be able to see, speak etc. in future beyond what it's now already doing well that is reading and writing.

2️⃣ Shaheen Gemma 7B, a model being finetuned on Urdu Alpaca dataset. It's great to see more fine-tuned LLMs in all regional languages in India. Lot of folks are putting effort in bringing my mothertongue language to fore in realm of Generative models.

3️⃣ Anwesha Sen wrote a very well written blog post about the previous AI advisory by govt of India and talk about it's vague clauses, terms which was like a stepping back into license raj.
