It's been a long time since, I published a blog post. It's almost been 1 year before I posted my [Sarvam joining blogpost](https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2024/sarvam_ai_joining.html).
But I just thought, let me write a blog post about [Pune FOSS 3.0  Conference event](https://fossunited.org/c/pune/punefoss3)
as one of the panelist - Mukta Aphale, said having a blog is one of the ways to stand out. Yet it also for me a way to check point one of my 
goals for this year which is to travel a few cities in India. So this year till now, I have travelled 5 cities so far
which is Mysore, Kozhikode, Ooty, Chennai and now Pune.

The idea to come to this particular conference, came as a result of talking to [Rahul, who is CEO of Fossunited](https://fossunited.org/u/rahulporuri)
who recommended me that if you want to visit more cities - Chalo come to FOSS United events. He recommended lot of events will happen
this summer and I noticed both PuneFOSS and MumbaiFOSS are happening in April, 2025.

I came a bit late to the event around 12PM, but was greeted by the familiar face of [Vishal Arya, who is Program Director @ FOSS United](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wisharya/?originalSubdomain=in). We chitchatted for a while and the first session I attended was by
Aayushi and Aarathy from Redhat, who talked about web accessibility. It was an informative session about - The A11y Revolution: How Small Changes Lead to Big Impact. 

Over the lunch break, I got a chance to talk with 2-3 folks who asked about Sarvam and asked me few questions in AI/ML. Then I got to talk
with [Nemo](https://captnemo.in/), whom I previously met in FOSSMEET 2024 and I am a huge fan of his work. Nemo is now part of
FOSS United governing board and we discussed about the work I am doing at Sarvam, some things we can do better etc, his open-source projects
like [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/), [blr.today project](https://blr.today/), where he is living now
(we both are living pretty close now actually). It's pretty cool to meet someone like Nemo who comes with so much experience and has been in 
FOSS Community for a long time. I am so excited about what he will do in FOSS United community this year.

We had a nice lunch, with some small papads, roti, fruits, two variety of curries, butter milk etc. It's crazy how well FOSS United, which is 
a non-profit organization is having such a nice event. This was followed by a panel discussion on Beyond the Buzzwords and Figuring Out Career Growth: Challenges, Choices & FOSS.
