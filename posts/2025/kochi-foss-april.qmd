## Talk in 30 seconds

Talked about why frusturation of doing same thing again and again lead to whisper-normalizer python package creation.
Since I was the first person to put it out in the world, got lot of traction with 1M+ downloads and SEO in google and LLMs
like perplexity helped me. We, in the sense Kavya Manohar and me, identified some crucial bugs in Malayalam Text
Normalizer, which was later fixed by us and is still needing more work to do. I talked in the end, an exlusive content
about my speaking journey so far. How I started talking from a small meetup in Kochi and now have spoken in multiple
International conferences so far, like speaking thrice in Pycon India by the age of 25.

## Questions asked?

1. How to add a normalizer to new language? What are the changes required to make?
