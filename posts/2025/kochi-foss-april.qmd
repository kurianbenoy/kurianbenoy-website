## Talk in 30 seconds

Talked about how the frustration of doing the same thing repeatedly led to the creation of the whisper-normalizer Python package.
Since I was the first person to put it out in the world, it gained a lot of traction with over 1 million downloads, and factors 
like Google SEO and LLMs like Perplexity helped. Kavya Manohar and I identified some crucial bugs in the Malayalam Text Normalizer,
which we later fixed, although it still requires further work. Towards the end, I shared some exclusive content about my speaking journey so far.
I discussed how I started speaking at a small meetup in Kochi and have now spoken at multiple international conferences, including presenting three times at Pycon India by the age of 25.

## Questions asked?

1. How to add a normalizer to new language? What are the changes required to make?
