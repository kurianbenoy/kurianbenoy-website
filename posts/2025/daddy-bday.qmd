Few weeks, back I told about me working on one of my passion projects. I recently completed the project. The project was to curate
speeches of certain Christian preacher, as a birthday gift for my grandfather(whom we call daddy).

He has been believing in the idea of Speech to Text to convert speeches to Book. My mother, Dr. Anu Thomas and I worked on this project
and presented this to him a few days. He was obviously very happy that his vision was fulfilled. I am glad to have played a small part
in making this happen.
