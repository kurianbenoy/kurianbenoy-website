    "Start by learning i to start inserting text, arrow keys to move around, escape to go back to command mode, and :wq to close and save. At that point you can use vim to edit your shell scripts and stuff. Then try and learn maybe one or two new commands each day like motion commands w and b are useful to move forward and backward a word.\n",

You will be like my god you know how would i ever get to that point ... the goal is not to be an expert at Vim the goal is to like be able to use Vim to like slowly do something that you want to be able to do.\n",

So I kind of forced myself to do things involving lists with databases for a while even though I got slower and then I was like ... I'm going to start doing more stuff with VBA macros and stop doing stuff manually and again it was kind of slower for a while and then became faster.\n",

It's not to say that there are none that are of any use ... but like they're not that useful honestly and you can get lost in that whole like customizing things thing. I just wanted to make it clear to say that actually out of the box Vim works fine and you customize with vimrc configurations.\n",
