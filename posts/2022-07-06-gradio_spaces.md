title: Getting featured in Spaces of the week and my latest two gradio spaces

---

I recently created two gradio based webapps, and one of my spaces - Paddy Doctor got featured
in list of hugging face Spaces of the week.

Both gradio apps based on two kaggle competitions which I have been participating in. Both are on computer vision models with one to identify the type of disease in the paddy crop and another to identify the name of flowers(which I am terribly bad at remembering names).

Do checkout the links below for the spaces
