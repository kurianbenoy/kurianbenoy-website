Hello world...

 TinkerHub recently conducted a Build From Home initiative to encourage college/school going students to build from selected project. I got an opportunity to be a BFH sponsor for Machine learning, and I am simply amazed by the their work.
BFH Makers were asked to do everything from collecting data, to training ML models and doing experiments, building a webapp/api to do the inference of results. Some team have even gone ahead and even deployed it in a span of 7-9 days.
I would like to congratulate all the future data scientists for doing great work and waiting to see more of your awesome projects. Also I would like to thank @abid, @gopi chettai, @kurianjacob, @Tinkerhub team for this awesome initiative and giving me an opportunity to be a mentor.
