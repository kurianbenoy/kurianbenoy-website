title: Log 0- Learning FastBook along with study group

---

I have been recently planning to delve more into learning deep learning and doing more machine learning projects for some time. As a first step,
I am excited to share about the [Fast Book Study Group Sessions](https://wandb.me/fastbook). It's great to have experts who are 10 steps 
ahead of you to help in your learning journey and learn together for the next 25+ weeks ahead.

I ordered the hard copy of the book Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch with a resolution to complete the book, over the fast.ai
course. I am indebted to Jeremy Howards, for all the amazing work they have done over the year which has bought me in a position to even buy
this book. Thanks Jeremy for your involvement in Masks for all movement :).

I ordered the book from [Computer Bookshop](https://www.cb-india.com/?currency=INR) and it reached my house in a week despite the Covid situation here in India.

So I am sharing a photo of my setup for these sessions, every thursday morning for next 25 weeks lead by [Aman Arora](https://twitter.com/amaarora).

Wish me good luck in my journey. I am thrilled to have few of my doubts answered by Jeremy Howards, Aman Aroroa, Kevin Bird, Sam Watkins and Will Sanger already.
