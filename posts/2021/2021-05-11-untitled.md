Hello, I am sharing a bit about the unusual time period we are now in. We are now in a triple lock down situation here in Ernakulam.
It is a quite unusual situation now right? - even kerala is crumbling with the fear of COVID-19 and the deaths are rising more and more.

When on April 29, I realised Areeb Jamal was not longer. It send a shock in me. The life is too short, let's not play for status games and
work on cool stuff. The oxygen cylinders are running out of supply. 

Is working on your dream goals worth it? On writing is what I am reading now.
