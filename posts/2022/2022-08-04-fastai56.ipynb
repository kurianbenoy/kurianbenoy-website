Yet during one month break during which [Jeremy's live-coding sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM) were held. I got some time to play with Paddy disease classification competition with this competition with other fastai friends also.\n",

Without these four notebooks and [Jeremy's live-coding sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM), it wouldn't have been possible.\n",
