title: Practical Deep Learning for Coders Course - Lesson 0
---

![](/posts/images/lesson0.jpg)

Last few weeks, I enrolled for the live cohort of Deep Learning For Coders
with fastai Couse which is going to be taken by Jeremy Howard. It's' a previlege
at the same time, a dream come true moment for me, as a fastai student who took
some part of fast.ai from the year 2018.

Whatever I have done in ML can be partly attributed to the way and the Jeremy
motivated students to be world class researchers. The fastai course has seen lot
of success stories from folks like Aman Arora, Deoldify creator, Sanyam Bhutani, Even Oldrige, Jason Antic
Radek, Zach Mueller, Wayde Gilliam and much more. Jeremy has inspired and enabled
multiple people to be practitioners in Deep Learning. {bhuvani an example}

I still feel I am a late boomer, and due to pursuing a work along with academics.
I am in a position to be extremely careful with what I spend time with and
things I do.

I will do following:

1. Try out every notebook given by Jeremy during class and writes in Kaggle
2. breath and look through pytorch tutorials
3. Write blogpost every week with lesson summary and occasionally on new things I learning
during course.
4. Participate in NLP competition provided by jeremy link

I won't do:

1. Won't read Pytorch book(even though it's very tempting to do)
2. Be active in twitter during course
3. Read EDA notebooks
4. Won't write any notebooks in tensorflow :)
