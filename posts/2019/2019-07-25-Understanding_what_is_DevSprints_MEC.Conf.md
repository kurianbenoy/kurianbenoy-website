title: What is DevSprints (MEC.conf)?

---

Has contributing to Open source projects been one of those plans for you that just remained a plan? Or did you try contributing to an Open source project but got lost somewhere in the middle due to
lack of guidance? Well, dev sprints are here to save the day! During Dev sprints, Mentors/Contributors of Open source projects guide participants through everything, from generating the development
build to submitting a patch for a bug.

It doesnt matter if you are a newbie or an experienced contributor, just dive in and get to work. It is also a great opportunity to understand and experience the ways of the Open source. Although, there
will be situations when you might feel stuck, but there is nothing to worry about as the mentors present there can provide you instant help to get you moving. We can say this from experience,
that participants of these dev sprints have not been limited to their Open source contribution just for the conference days.They are still active contributors.

So at MEC.Conf we are having these organisations mainly:

-  FOSSASIA
-  Zulip
-  Mozilla
-  MEC.Contrib
-  DVC

And there will be a bunch of interesting personal projects as well.

## Format

Our Devsprints are planned to be held for 14 hours from 27th July,2019 to 28th July. So unlike hackathons, in Devsprints there is no prizes and biggest take away is  being part of a community and help in some long term project by contribute to open source projects by putting up a few PRs for the organisation. Unlike when you are talking and contributing to a unkwown person's project. Here we have mentors who will help you get started contributing to various projects.
