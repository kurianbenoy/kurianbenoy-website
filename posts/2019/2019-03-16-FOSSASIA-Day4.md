This was a day where things were getting a bit serious. I was in Hackathon room
for almost the entire day. Being a lone hacker, you sometimes gets to a point
were you change ideas, loose momentum and even get depressed during Hackathon.
There were some people who were mentoring Students there, and now I changed my
Idea once again to something giving better interpretion of the Keralarescue.in.
I planned on to use Watson Natural language apis and Kuberneetes. Kurd ie Sai
vennam told me it was pretty easy to change from docker-compose to kubernetees
and I started migrating process. He helped me a lot and told what all to get
things working. I and Sai started opening a Cluster and doing even more cooler
stuff. I attended a panel discussion and later attended amazing sessions. There
was an amazing session about TF2.0 by Guardeon and Accesibily of ML:MLHub. I
continued hacking even at Hostel and started preparing for my lightining talks.
