title: Thoughts on linux distros

---

Linux comes in different variants based on your taste, interest and system design choices. Some of the most notable
ones are: Ubuntu, Fedora, Redhat, Debian, Arch Linux. There are more than 1000of variants of linux. One of my college seniors
,[Sarath Lakshman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarathlakshman/) made a linux variant called Slynux. You can choose whichever linux variant as you want to be your
favourite. If
you are someone new to Linux World you can use linux distributions like Ubuntu/ Fedora/Linux Mint. My personal favourite
beginner linux variant is Linux mint as it resembles very likely to Windows.

**I welcome all of you to Linux world :)**
