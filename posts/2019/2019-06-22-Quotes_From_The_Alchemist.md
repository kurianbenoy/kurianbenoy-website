The Alchemist is written by the famous Brazilian lyricist and novelist Paulo
Coelho. I recently finished reading his book and am sharing some of amazing
quotes I liked from his books. The last quote made me start reading this amazing
book.

>” That’s what Alchemist do. They show that when we strive to become better that
>we are, everything around us becomes better too”.

> “Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart”.

>” When you want something, the entire Universe conspires for the same”

>“There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of
>failure.”

> “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to
> achieve it.”

> A merchant sends his son to a sage to learn the secret to happiness. After
> traversing for forty days, the boy arrived at the luxurious palace of the
> sage, atop a hillock. He had to wait for two hours before seeing the polymath.
> 'Do you want to know the secret to happiness?' asked the sage. "I am too busy
> to explain it right now. Go round the mansion to see the myriads of things
> there and come to me after two hours. While you saunter around the castle,
> make sure that the oil is not lost", the old man said, after handing over a
> spoon with two drops of oil over to the boy. The boy strolled around the manor
> for two hours, but all his attention was on the spoon. After two hours, he
> presented himself before the wise man. "Did you not see everything?" the old
> man asked. "I could not watch everything clearly", he told the truth. "Never`
> mind, go around and relish the beauty of this edifice anew", the old squire
> said. The boy felt elated. He set out to enjoy the elegance of the manor in a
> new way, holding the spoon containing two drops of oil. He admired the murals
> and frescoes on the ceiling, luxuriant gardens, captivating landscapes and
> panorama of the mountain ranges beyond all measure. Again, he appeared before
> the sagacious man and made an account of what he had seen. "What happened to
> the two drops of oil?" the mentor asked. Only then did the boy realize that
> the spoon had been empty.The secret of happiness lies in looking at all the
> marvels of the world without forgetting the drops of oil in the spoon" the old
> man spoke very prudently; here the 'oil' stands for moral values while the
> 'spoon' for life. "
