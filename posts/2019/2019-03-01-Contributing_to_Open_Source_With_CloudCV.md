title: Contributing to OpenSource With CloudCV

![](/posts/images/cloudcv.png)

So here I am going to describe about experience contributing CloudCV organisation. I started to know about this organisation because of my friend Adarsh S who is a perivious GSoC winner, with CloudCV.
CloudCV has mainly three Projects ie:

- EvalAI - a Open source platform for Machine Learning Competitions like Kaggle
- Origami - A services to make your Machine learning models deployable anywhere in WEb
- Fabrik - A model making software

I started contributing to Origami initially from January. I started solving some issues initially. But the organisation mentors were not so active
So some basic PR's I put in Origami didn't get merged as they were not active. I became also active in forums. Being Discouraged by lack of inactivity, I pinged sometime in January end, Cloud CV org Administrator.
RishabJain told to me on pinging him that Origami won't be participating this time. Instead of that he told me to start contributing on EvalAI instead.
Some of the PR's I worked on Origami were related updating docs and requirements.


Then I started contributing to EvalAI. EvalAI is actually is a competition platform for Deep Learning and Machine Learning challenges. It's quite similar to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Yet EvalAI has
certain amazing features which make it popular among universities and other organisation. Do checkout more about EvalAI [here](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/blob/master/README.md).

SO far I have worked on following PR's:

- [Add Leaderboard sorting for featured challenges:](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/pull/2097)

	This PR gave me an opportunity to learn about AngularJS. It made me learn about navigating through large code. Honestly it was lot of copy pasting as similar functionality was implemented in Challenges
Module.
- [Add slug field](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/pull/2132) 

It taught me a lot about writing proper pep8 code and incorporating feedback from Mentors.

- [Tweet button](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/pull/2139) - another learning experience

Merged PR

- [Docsfix](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/pull/2112)
- [Firstfix](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/pull/2042)

I know the docs fix doesn't match the patch requirement for Gsoc. Anyways I am looking to learn and contributing to this amazing community of EvalAI. Now `Atlanda Time Now` has been now my frequently queried
Search result now.
