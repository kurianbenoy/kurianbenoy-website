title: FOSSASIA Summit - Day 2

---

Today was when the 4 day long FOSSASIA International Conference started. We woke
up a bit late, due to some time difference. The first talk which I attended was
the State of OpenTech by Mario Behling. When I was sitting the crowd, I noticed
someone who was from VideoLAN. I just went ahead and told to him how much I
liked VLC and asked if he could introduce me to Remi for being part of my
opensource interview series. He replied back saying I am Remi. There was a
feeling of suprisement and afraidness after meeting Remi.

I had heard a lot about this guy. He was the lead Software developer of VideoLAN
and wrote a lot of code(about 20% which Francois clarified to me). I have heard
he gives a lot of strong comments to patches in VLC, just like Linus Torvalds is
famous for. Yet here he is sitting just besides me. I asked for a quick selfie
and was too afraid even to be sitting besides him.

I told about the interview thing and told I will come when he is free. I ran virtually away from Remi, during Lunch break.
There were amazing sessions about how Hardware can be used from Mitch and
Bunni. At next we had a panel discussion about "Buisness,Government,Science-What Opportunities Does "Open" Bring to
society" composing of an amazing panel with V Srinivasta, Hong Pong, Graham Williams, Carlsen, Bunnie and our own FOSSASIA Fellows Mario Behling and
Hong Pong. I explored the Exhibition hall in the evening and attended another panel discussion on "Is future of FOSS Bright?!" lead by Michael
Downey.
