Since I am frequent book purchaser from Mathrubhumi book, during January I got a notification to buy early bird tickets
for [MBIFL 2023](https://www.mbifl.com/speakers-2023/). I immediately bought 4 days tickets to attend literature festival. When it came to February, I realised
due to some commitements in home and work, I couldn't attend all the days of this literature festival despite having ticket.

MBIFL had almost 300+ speakers, with famous speakers like Nobel prize winners, brooker prize winners, politicians etc.

Yet for me personally, I had just one wish. [Benyamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benyamin_(writer)) is an author who has written lot of thriller novels like 
അൽ - അറേബ്യൻ നോവൽ ഫാക്‌ടറി  and മുല്ലപ്പു നിറമുള്ള പകലുകൾ(which is a dual novel) along with the famous ആടു ജീവിതം(Goat Days). I just wanted to meet
him in person and get an autograph in my copy of favourite novel.

I travelled early morning from my house and reached the venue by almost 10:30AM. During this time, there was a
conversational sessions about Pravasha Aksharamala with P Sreeramkrishan, Benyamin, etc. After session, there
was a huge fan base to meet author Benyamin. I first went to get signature from another author KV Mohan Kumar in panel, and then waited
in queue to then get signature from Benyamin.

After lot of books were signed by Benyamin which was bought by his fans with some of his famous works like ആടു ജീവിതം, മാന്തളിരിലെ ഇരുപത് കമ്മ്യൂണിസ്ററ് വർഷങ്ങൾ,
അൽ - അറേബ്യൻ നോവൽ ഫാക്‌ടറി. I got my copy also signed with a salutation of snehattode(with love). I just asked my
favourite author does a person named Sameera praveen who was a character in Jasmine Days, really exist.
Benyam answered that it's mixture of multiple people who he had seen in his life, yet there is no one such person doesn't exist lie
Sameera Parveen similar to Najeeb in ആടു ജീവിതം.


My mission of the travelling was just completed in one hour and I got few more authors signature like Shabini Vasudev who is an author from Baharin and from
Vinu V John, who is the star anchor of Asianet news(who kindly reminded me he is not famous to be in this list).

After that I attended talk with Aparna Balamurali and Captian GR Gopinath. Shashi Tharoor talked on his book Pride, Prejudice and Punditry.
Seeing Tharoor answer question to a student it reminded me of India's former people's president APJ. I wish him all the success as a politician.

One of the last sessions I attended that day was by Polish author Justi Guziak on  Know yourself to express yourself. 
This session talked about improvising and had lot of hands on workshop to learn this art. During the session, the speakers
gave me a chit with a question `what was the best gift you have ever recieved?`. This question was to be asked to someone 
who was in the other end of crowd. I gave my question and Janaki who was from Thiruvanthupuram told me the best gift she
ever received was a dog she received when she was in her 7th standard. This dog has been living with her for the past 15 years as
a constant when she went through her school, then college and even after her marriage. Another situation which was given during 
the workshop was to convince Mr Karun to give something valuable in his hand. After lot of convincing, I was able to share the lunch
with Karun.


That winded up MBIFL 2023, a literature festival for me a datascientist who doesn't have anything related to it. It was 
cool to interact and meet with so many cool people. I am looking forward to MBIFL 2023 soon..
