## Hi, I'm Kurian Benoy <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" alt="Waving hand to say hello">

I am an AI Engineer & Team Lead working in [Sentient.io](https://www.sentient.io/en/), a fast-paced startup based in Singapore. I have multiple years of experience in Python and Machine learning experience. I have contributed to various open source organizations like Keras,
DVC, HuggingFace, fast.ai, Swathanthra Malayalam Computing, CloudCV etc.

I like to speak and interact with developer community. I am an active member of [fast.ai community](https://forums.fast.ai/u/kurianbenoy/summary) and engage
in lot of other communities based in Kerala. I have given talk as expert in competence of Machine Learning and core Python
in [Pycon India](https://in.pycon.org), which is the largest gathering of Pythonistas in India for the Python programming language.

I believe in the old Malayalam proverb, "അണ്ണാൻ കുന്നിനും തന്നാൽ ആവത്". In English it translates to this meaning - "A small rabbit does what it can do it's best of abilities, similarly we should also strive to do everything to best of our abilities.".
