## About Me

Hello everyone!

Hi, I am a Machine Learning Engineer working in [Sentient.io](https://www.sentient.io/en/), a startup based in Singapore.

I have multiple years of experience in Python and Machine learning experience, where I am now
looking more into the MLOPs side. I have contributed to various open source organizations like Keras,
DVC, HuggingFace, fast.ai, Swathanthra Malayalam Computing, CloudCV etc.

I like to speak and interact with developer community. I am an active member of [fast.ai community](https://forums.fast.ai/u/kurianbenoy/summary) and engage
in lot of other communities based in Kerala. I have given talk as expert in competence of Machine Learning and core Python
in [Pycon India](https://in.pycon.org), which is the largest gathering of Pythonistas in India for the Python programming language.

I follow an open to contact policy anyone, so feel free to reach me anytime. I am quite easy to reach out via [email](mailto:kurian.bkk@gmail.com) or
