Disclaimer: ML stands not for machine learning, but for Malayalam 

Swathanthra Malayalam in association with Tinkerhub conducted a special program called **People behind SMC**. *SMC is
preimier* organisation working in the area of Malayalam computing. It was interesting to listen to experiences of
various folks like Anivar, Santhosh thottingal sir, Balasankar C, Jishnu Mohan, Kavya Manohar, .. The sessions was
hosted by Hrishi Chettai in Tinkerhubs instagram pages. The recorded sessions can be found <here>

After listening to these talks, I want to share some ideas which came in my mind:

### 1. Teaching Language computing with Python

Santhosh thottingal sir usually starts most of his beginner talks, by asking a cliche example like has anyone tried to
code in Malayalam? He usually shows a C sample code for Hello world, and first time I saw this I was really fascinated
which lead to [artcle link]. Seeing this Adithya and Subin even coded with old style malayalam letters, and this was the
first time I was seeing writings in Malayalam digits. 

There is a lot of difference, when you start thinking of programming with Malayalam instead of English. There will 4
bytes for Malayalm instead of 1 bytes. It may be good to create a progrmming guide on how to program in Python for
Language computing for various applications.

I personally feel this can be a good topic to talk in any Pycon conference, as this area is relatively being
under-utilised.

### 2. Covid-19 dataset

Kerala has put up a commendable performance so far in facing Covid-19 panademic. KHA has been writing daily health
bulletins written using Manjeri font. One of common criticism Kerala model has been seen is the lack of scientific papers 
being published. Another idea in my mind is to create a dataset of KHA bulletins so people can study these Kerala model
and dataset can be placed in SMC project's text corpus. The initial data has been collected and uploaded <kaggle
dataset>. Yet one of the challenges is how to convert these PDFs to a useful format for data analysis. In Kaggle they
converted the CORD dataset into a no of JSon files.
