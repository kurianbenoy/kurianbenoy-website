  <title>Debconf Tshirt memories</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This Tshirt brings back so much memories.</p>
<p>DebConf 2023 was one of the most enriching conferences I’ve attended—diverse, high-quality, and deeply impactful. But more than anything, it reminds me of my dear friend, the late Abraham Raji. He passed away on the outing day of DebConf, and his absence is still felt.</p>
<p>Abraham designed this Tshirt with the unique Kerala impression.</p>
<p>Abraham gave me an opportunity to speak in my college—at DebUtsav 2023. I still remember his words: “Kurian, you’ve grown into a confident public speaker. You’ve made it.”</p>
<p>The journey wasn’t always smooth. My first talk didn’t go well, and I faced harsh criticism from an experienced speaker who told me I would never make it to speak at PyCon India. That criticism became fuel for my determination. By age 25, I had spoken at PyCon India three times.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best response to doubt is simply proving them wrong. When someone tells you that you can’t do something, remember: you absolutely can. It’s about perseverance, learning from feedback, and never giving up on your goals.</p>

<p>Talked about how the frustration of doing the same thing repeatedly led to the creation of the whisper-normalizer Python package. Since I was the first person to put it out in the world, it gained a lot of traction with over 1 million downloads, and factors like Google SEO and LLMs like Perplexity helped. Kavya Manohar and I identified some crucial bugs in the Malayalam Text Normalizer, which we later fixed, although it still requires further work. Towards the end, I shared some exclusive content about my speaking journey so far. I discussed how I started speaking at a small meetup in Kochi and have now spoken at multiple international conferences, including presenting three times at Pycon India by the age of 25.</p>

  <title>Attending Pune FOSS 3.0 Conference</title>

<section id="why-writing-a-blogpost-after-long-time" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-writing-a-blogpost-after-long-time">Why writing a blogpost after long time?</h3>
<p>It’s been a long time since I published a blog post. It’s been almost a year since I posted my <a href="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2024/sarvam_ai_joining.html">Sarvam joining blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I thought I’d write a post about the Pune FOSS 3.0 Conference. One of the panelists, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muktaa/">Mukta Aphale</a>, mentioned that having a blog is a great way to stand out. For me, it’s also a way to check off one of my goals this year: to travel to a few cities in India. So far this year, I’ve traveled to Mysore, Kozhikode, Ooty, Chennai, and now Pune.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-experience-at-pune-foss-3.0" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-experience-at-pune-foss-3.0">My Experience at Pune FOSS 3.0</h3>
<p>The idea to attend this conference came from a conversation with <a href="https://fossunited.org/u/rahulporuri">Rahul, CEO of FOSS United,</a> who suggested that if I wanted to visit more cities, I should check out FOSS United events. He mentioned there would be several events this summer, and I saw that both PuneFOSS and MumbaiFOSS are happening in April 2025.</p>
<p>I arrived at the event a bit late—around 12 PM—but was greeted by the familiar face of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wisharya/?originalSubdomain=in">Vishal Arya</a>, Program Director at FOSS United. We chatted for a while. The first session I attended was by Aayushi and Aarathy from Red Hat, who spoke about web accessibility. It was an informative session titled The A11y Revolution: How Small Changes Lead to Big Impact.</p>
<p>During lunch, I spoke with a few people who asked about Sarvam and had some questions on AI/ML. I also caught up with <a href="https://captnemo.in/">Nemo</a>, whom I met earlier at FOSSMEET 2024. I’m a big fan of his work. He’s now on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fossunited_meet-the-newly-elected-governance-board-of-activity-7312793478101364737-L9In/">governing board of FOSS United</a>. We discussed the work I’m doing at Sarvam, some improvements we could make, and his open-source projects like endoflife.date and blr.today. Turns out we now live quite close to each other. It’s always great to meet someone like Nemo, who has deep experience and long-standing involvement in the FOSS community. I’m excited to see what he’ll bring to FOSS United this year.</p>
<p>We had a nice lunch, with some small papads, roti, fruits, two variety of curries, butter milk etc. It’s impressive how well FOSS United, a non-profit, organized such a quality event. This was followed by two panel discussions on <code>Beyond the Buzzwords</code> and <code>Figuring Out Career Growth: Challenges, Choices &amp; FOSS</code>.</p>
<p>The panel featured Vipul A M, Mukta Aphale, and Aditya Godbole, moderated by Chinmay Naik. There was discussion around AI tools, past tech trends like blockchain and cloud, and how they panned out.</p>
<p>A big takeaway was that to succeed in your career, you must be so good they can’t ignore you. If you can explain what you do to your grandparents, you’ve truly mastered it. Blogging was highly encouraged by both Mukta and Aditya.</p>
<p>They also shared what they look for in candidates. Mukta checks blogs and GitHub profiles. Aditya said he doesn’t care about GitHub at all—he looks for the “kida” (curiosity/drive). He values depth and whether the person enjoys the journey. Skills like communication and coding still matter, of course.</p>
<p>Vipul emphasized that communication is essential, especially in consulting. 90% of your effectiveness depends on it. Even 15–20% of his day sometimes goes into correcting grammatical errors in client communication. Writing clean code is one thing; articulating your work is another essential skill.</p>
<p>Empathy also came up—both in product development (understanding users) and within teams (being kind and empathetic). In another panel, people discussed how contributing to FOSS projects might not directly help land a job, but it demonstrates passion, which definitely matters</p>
<p>One standout talk was Why I Didn’t Sell endoflife.date by Nemo. So a bit about <a href="https://endoflife.date/">endoflife.date website</a>, which is an informational website about 400+ products which gives concise information about open-source and closed-source projects which are popular like Kubernetees, Apple watch, iphones etc. This website has per month about 9 million impression, 200K clicks and consumes almost 1TB bandwidth. He shared how it was manually done for like 1 year, but then he started automating project so release fixes are automatically mentioned in the project. So that he needn’t always manually check for things in upstream website. Few folks, came to buy this website. But he didn’t sell as he never trusted them to be someone like him who cares deeply about the project.</p>
<p>Also he talked about how you should have proper guiding principles, contributor guidelines for open-source project. He also talked about what folks should do to build great open-source project.</p>

<p>The session wrapped up with the organizers thanking everyone. It was great meeting people, exploring a new city, and attending such an engaging event.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-takeaways-from-punefoss-3.0">🔑 Key Takeaways from PuneFOSS 3.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blogging matters: Several panelists emphasized writing as a way to stand out and reflect on your journey.</li>
<li>Career growth ≠ hype chasing: Don’t blindly follow buzzwords. Be really good at your core work and know how to explain it simply.</li>
<li>FOSS ≠ job guarantee, but shows passion: Contributions might not land you a job directly but reflect depth, consistency, and interest.</li>
<li>Communication is everything: Whether you’re writing code, consulting, or leading—being able to explain clearly is a huge differentiator.</li>
<li>Empathy wins: With teammates, with users, and with contributors in the open-source world.</li>
<li>Have principles: For open-source maintainers, guiding principles and contributor guidelines are crucial. Nemo’s refusal to sell endoflife.date shows how important intent and vision are for project sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Until, next time. See you very soon.</p>

  <title>I am joining as ML Engineer to build Full-Stack GenAI at Sarvam.ai</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2024/sarvam_ai_joining.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m really excited to share with all of you that I have joined as an ML engineer at Sarvam AI today to build full-stack GenAI applications for Indian languages. I would like to first of all thank my parents (Benoy K Kuriakose and Dr.&nbsp;Anu Thomas), my sister and grandmother. You were there with me in all my ups and downs. I am really happy to make you proud.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have to thank the people who got me interested in Malayalam computing. Santhosh Thottingal in his keynote at MEC.Conf in 2019, told us why working in Malayalam language is so valuable. Lot of people have helped and encouraged me to work in Malayalam language namely Dr.&nbsp;Kavya Manohar, Santhosh Thottingal, Dr.&nbsp;Manu Madhavan and Dr.&nbsp;Alex Strick van Linschoten. Members of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing was a constant suppport.</p>
<p>A big thanks to my ML Guruji Jeremy Howard (fast.ai courses where so great), members of various communities I was involved like FOSS, Python etc. Similarly I am pursuing my master from IIIT Kottayam, my bachelors was from Govt Model Engineering College and I studied my school at St Peters. The list of teachers and folks who helped me in every place is immense, so not naming everyone. And last but not least, I would like to thank Almighty God for his grand plans for me.</p>
<p>Also I am really thankful for the trust founders of Sarvam.ai Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar put in me to join their organization. Also special shout out to Saurabh Karn and Abhigyan Raman for make the whole interview process so special.</p>

<p>My last working day at Sentient.io was in the past week. It was a great experience working in an AI-based company for over 2 years now and being part of building a lot of cool projects for large reputed clients clients of Sentient.io.</p>
<p>I was working in the awesome science &amp; research(SnR) team with members like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/weinadu/">Weina Du</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zqthedesigner/">Zhang Qiao</a>, Jian Hui, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-lee-7284315/">Eugene Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrasekar01/">Chandra Sekar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreya-kishore-624a17190/">Shreya Kishore</a>. I am grateful for some of the ex SnR members like Keng-Teck Ma, Divya Dilip and Clement Tee who helped me a lot and guided me.</p>
<p>I had good rapport with everyone in Sentient.io from Christopher Yeo, Eddie LEONG, CFA, Linda Su Ling Tan, Gloria Koh, Priya Somasundaram , Cedrick Tay ,Aalind Singh, Michael Ng, Mani, Karunakar Vanama, Ramesh.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my time there and now it’s a time to bid good bye. I even got an opportunity to visit the Sentient.io Singapore office and have a lunch with the team, when I went to speak in FOSSASIA Summit, Singapore last year. Zhang Qiao and Solomon Sim (sentient.io alum) are in the selfie with me.</p>
<p>The above message was posted originally in Linkedin <sup>1</sup></p>
<hr>
<p>I enjoyed working in a startup. Yet it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, I will ask you think twice before joining any startup. In Sentient.io, I saw both the positive’s and negatives of working in a startup. It was a roller-coaster ride, yet there is one good reason why you should consider joining a startup.</p>
<p>You learn a ton of things, get engaged in lot of projects. So if you prioritize learning in your career, Kurian would recommend joining a startup. <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html">Chip in her article ’7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to</a>’ <sup>2</sup> said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I once read somewhere that joining startups is the only way to get 15 years of experience in 5 years. I couldn’t agree more.</p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Matching my former github streak at the age of 25</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2024/github_streak.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Matching the vigor of my early 20s has proven challenging as time progresses. There’s a particular enjoyment in maintaining GitHub streaks, even just for the sake of it.</p>
<p>In the recent months, I’ve been engaged with intriguing open-source projects such as indicsubtitler.in, FOSSMEET Talks, MalWhisper, Samam ML Verification Project, among other initiatives. I doubted my ability to sustain the same zeal I had in my early 20s, especially now that I’m 25, balancing a full-time job, daily chores, and life’s other responsibilities</p>
<p>Yet I suceeded in that and I am super proud of myself in that 😊.</p>

<p>🗓️ Monday:</p>
<p>The Government of India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY) made an announcement regarding the deployment of ML models in production. While it was initially interpreted as a requirement for all, they clarified that it applies mainly to large organizations and not startups or Indie Hackers. This topic is still in the early stages of discussion, and we can expect further regulation in the future.</p>

  <title>Chess is sometimes more entertaining than Cricket</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/chess.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Chess is occasionally more entertaining than cricket, and this notion was brought to light during the finals of the Global Chess League between Triveni Continental Kings and upGrad Mumbai Masters. As an Indian, this statement may seem controversial, but it is important to acknowledge that this is not always the case. Having witnessed the match between these two teams, I can confidently argue for the entertainment value of chess in certain instances.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ipz5yp3HzL4" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>While I personally struggle with playing chess and do not derive much enjoyment from it, I find watching chess matches and following the intriguing personalities in the chess world to be quite engaging. The particular match I am referring to was a team tournament with six players on each team, competing fiercely for their respective sides. The format involved the iconic board, two men’s boards, two women’s boards, and a prodigy board.</p>
<p>The tournament began with two rapid chess games, with each player having 15 minutes of time. In the first rapid game, Triveni Continental Kings emerged victorious while playing with the White pieces, but in the second rapid game, upGrad Mumbai Masters managed to win playing with the same color. Hence, the teams had to proceed into a blitz match with each player having only 5 minutes of time. Triveni Continental Kings played as White this time but unfortunately lost. Consequently, in a must-win game for Triveni Continental Kings playing as Black, they achieved the impossible under such pressure.</p>
<p>The tiebreaker resulted in a player-versus-player showdown, where three players from each team competed against one another. Surprisingly, all three matches ended in a draw, intensifying the level of suspense. The fate of the tournament ultimately rested on the final match between GM Jonas Bjerre from Denmark and GM Javokhir Sindarov. Remarkably, Sindarov had won all four of the matches played in the finals so far, adding an extra layer of excitement to this decisive game. The match concluded with Triveni Continental Kings emerging as the winners when Jonas defeated Sindarov with a checkmate, securing the victory for his team.</p>
<p>The tournament itself was well-organized, and as someone who has been following it for a few years, it was pleasing to witness its growing popularity. The event sponsors, Tech Mahindra, an Indian company, contributed to the grand prize of $500,000. This exemplifies the support of Indian companies like Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel who are increasingly involved in sponsoring major chess events. Moreover, India boasts talented prodigies like Gukesh, Arjun, Nihal, and Pragg, adding further excitement and intrigue to the world of chess.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while cricket holds a cherished place in the hearts of many, it is important to recognize that chess has its own unique and captivating qualities. The final match between Triveni Continental Kings and upGrad Mumbai Masters in the Global Chess League demonstrated the enthralling nature of the game. This particular encounter showcased the intense battles, strategic maneuvers, and moments of brilliance that chess has to offer. By expanding our perspective and appreciating the diverse aspects of sports and entertainment, we can fully embrace the thrilling world of chess alongside cricket.</p>

<p>The organizers of this meetup were fabulous. It was nice to interact with organizers like Mark, Richard, Riya, Subin, Devdutt etc. One of my friends Arun who was batch-mate at MEC took some nice photos of me speaking. It was a nice experience interacting with fellow speakers like Faiz Mohammed, Andrew Bastin and Maheshwaran. This meetup helped me to meet some new faces and reconnect with some familiar faces whom I knew since my college days. Overall attending the FOSS United Kochi Meetup was a great experience for me and felt the meetup is organized excellently.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Why is Malayalam more complex than other languages like Hindi, Marathi etc. While I understand the methodology of comparing type-to-token ratio (TTR), isn’t it possible that the dataset used for comparison may not include all the words of a particular language?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think whether just a privileged few people can do Machine Learning?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you think about Mojo, will it help in reducing the problem of few privileged people doing ML?</p></li>
<li><p>How much resources is required to fine tune Whisper models?</p></li>
<li><p>How much did it cost for you to do benchmarking in Malayalam?</p></li>
<li><p>Does a biriyani meal for a family in Singapore costs $30? (Apologies for my previous incorrect statement during the talk, where I mentioned the cost of one biriyani in Singapore might be about $30. This analogy was made to compare the cost of benchmarking models for Malayalam.)</p></li>
<li><p>I absoluted loved <code>whisper.cpp</code> because it’s able to provide timestamps as well, is it possible to implement timestamps in Malayalam as well?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your thoughts on LLM finetuning?</p></li>

<p>All the folks who asked questions and made the session interactive, a big thank you from my side. As a speaker, it was the first time I was satisfied with myself for making the session interactive. My session demanded an interactive session as my slot was just after having a delicious lunch of biriyani. Also a special thanks to the volunteer who distributed the chocolotes to folks who answered my quiz questions. The organizers of event were fabulous, a special mention to names of people I remember at time of writing. Thank you Jithin, Karthik, Alaka, Theerthana, Aneeta who was always there to help. Also it was nice to meet FOSSMEC faculty in charge Sony mam.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vegam-whisper-family-of-models">Vegam Whisper Family of Models</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper">faster-whisper</a> which is a reimplementation of OpenAI’s Whisper model using CTranslate2 speeds upto 4 times faster than <code>openai/whisper</code> for the same accuracy while using less memory.</p>
<p>CTranslate2 supports various quantization formats and we have trained models for the following quantization formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>float16</li>
<li>int16</li>
<li>float8</li>
<li>int8_float8</li>
<li>No quantization</li>
</ul>
<p>For Malayalam, I used the best model in my benchmarking study ie <a href="https://huggingface.co/thennal/whisper-medium-ml">thennal/whisper-medium-ml</a> and converted into all possible quantization weights.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-behind-the-name-of-vegam-and-pallakku">What is behind the name of Vegam and Pallakku?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vegam is a Malayalam word which means speed.</li>
<li>Pallakku is a Malayalam word which means a palanquin. It is a vehicle which is carried by people.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an author of these work, I just wanted to say the meaning of these words doesn’t really have anything to do with the package. Vegam might not be the fastest Malayalam ASR model and Pallakku is named not to refer to the old colonial times. I just named it for the sake of naming it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-was-the-expereince-presenting-demos">How was the expereince presenting demos?</h2>
<p>Demo presentations are events where you can interact with people during the scheduled time. There was an evaluation panel with one of chief guests of the event <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-t-ramalingeswara-rao-784a903a/">Dr.&nbsp;T Ramalingeswara Rao</a> from TCS and one of the professors.</p>
<p>These sessions brought a hacker kind of vibe back to me. I was really happy to receive lot of curious questions and smiles received from folks who came to visit my demo presentation. I set up the demo in such a way that there was a wireless microphone and I would play a few audio files. They used to rate the output of the model.</p>
<p>Some of my professors who taught me in previous semesters like <a href="https://www.iiitkottayam.ac.in/#!/faculty/keshab">Dr.&nbsp;Keshab Nath</a> visited to see my demo and gave me suggestions. It was a nice vibe to interact with a bunch of BTech students in their second semester from Andhra Pradhesh. Even though they were not able to understand Malayalam, they just hung around and asked me questions :D.</p>

  <title>Learning how to install malayalam fonts</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was working on Malayalam Speech to text models and the malayalam letters where not getting rendered properly. I was a bit irritated by it and I asked my friend <a href="https://thottingal.in/">Santhosh Thottingal</a> why <code>?</code> comes this way.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/malayalam_font2.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Malayalam rendered in Nirmala font.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Santhosh told me basically malayalam letters take 3 bytes compared to 1 byte for latin and if the text is broken in the middle of those 3 byte clusters, you will get invalid character and will be displayed as <code>?</code>.</p>
<p>Then he told me I was using one of the worst Malayalam fonts ie Nirmala by Microsoft which is the reason why I am seeing lot of rendering mistakes.</p>
<p>So I stopped working on Mayalam ASR models and thought of studying how to install Malayalam fonts.</p>
<p>I found personally two ways to install fonts and I want to share that here. There maybe another thousand different ways to install fonts which won’t be covered in this blogpost.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Installing with Malayalam Fonts - firefox plugins</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/malayalam-fonts/">plugin</a></li>
<li>Choose the fonts you want to use by selecting it firefox.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/firefox_plugin.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Installing on Microsoft Windows</li>
</ol>
<p>I just asked ChatGPT and it gave me the following steps to install fonts by SMC in Windows.</p>
<pre><code>To download SMC (Swathanthra Malayalam Computing) fonts for your Windows operating system, follow these steps:

1. Visit the SMC website: Go to the SMC website at https://smc.org.in/fonts/
using your web browser.

2. Choose the font: Browse through the available fonts and select the one you
want to download. SMC offers a variety of fonts for different purposes.

3. Download the font: Click on the download link or button associated with the
selected font. The font file will be downloaded to your computer as a
compressed (ZIP) file.

4. Extract the font: Locate the downloaded ZIP file and extract its contents.
Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" or use a third-party compression
tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the font files.

5. Install the font: After extracting the font files, double-click on the font file
with the extension ".ttf" or ".otf." A preview of the font will appear, and a dialog
box will open. Click on the "Install" button to install the font on your Windows system.

6. Font installation completion: Once the font is installed, you can start using it
in various applications such as word processors, graphic design software, or
web browsers. The font will be available for selection in the font menu
of compatible applications.

By following these steps, you should be able to download and install SMC fonts on your Windows
operating system. Remember to respect font licensing terms and only use the fonts
for their intended purposes.</code></pre>

<p>After all this I asked Santhosh whether I have installed Manjari font correctly and he said it’s correct. It’s not every day you get to ask the person who built that font whether I have installed the font correctly or not.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Note: For linux, all these fonts are preinstalled by default as it’s packaged as part of linux distros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am glad to have friends like <a href="https://thottingal.in/">Santhosh Thottingal</a> to ask questions like this. Santhosh has written lot of popular fonts in Malayalam like <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts/manjari">Manjari</a>, <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts/gayathri">Gayathri</a> and with his latest font <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts/nupuram">Nupuram</a> he has created almost 100+ fonts.</p>
<p>In my opinion SMC creates the best fonts in Malayalam and check their website section on <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts">fonts to learn more</a>. If you are interested to learn more about Malayalam Computing I had previously written a <a href="../../../posts/2019/2019-07-30-Malayalam_computing.html">blogpost</a> which is just a highlight of talk given by Santhosh on this topic.</p>

  <title>Tributes to my first python teacher- Dear Jumana mam!</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2016 when I joined my BTech. for Computer Science, I was someone who didn’t love programming and CS was only subject I didn’t get A1 in my class 12 boards. In my semester I was taught Python by a wonderful teacher. She taught in a beginner friendly way and encouraged anyone to ask doubts.</p>
<p>She told us programming was not something to by-heart and there are multiple way to solve the same problem. One year back I called my teacher and thanked her. By then I had spoken in Pycon India twice as an expert in machine learning and core-python and was able to pay my bills by coding in Python. She was really happy about me and even asked me to send even the videos of my talks.</p>
<p>My dear Jumana mam passed away today. I was really blessed to have such a wonderful teacher.</p>

<p>I talked about Malayalam language and what makes it hard to work compared to other high resource languages like English. Then I highlighted some of the Malayalam models build during Whisper event and why I went ahead to benchmark these models. These models where benchmarked on two datasets mainly Common Voice and Malayalam Speech Corpus. I also shared more about the <a href="https://huggingface.co/models?other=vegam">Vegam Whisper model family</a> for making whisper models faster. Also I shared about Malayalam speech to text demo <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/kurianbenoy/Pallakku">Pallakku</a> which I am developing now with Vegam whisper weights.</p>
