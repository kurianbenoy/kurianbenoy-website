<p>I talked about what is OpenAI whisper and some of it’s amazing feature. I highlighted the importance of fine-tuning Whisper in low-resource language like Malayalam which is able to get almost 90% accuracy compared to -10% accuracy of OpenAI whisper model weights. The results where calculated with a new github project called <a href="https://github.com/kurianbenoy/malayalam_asr_benchmarking">malayalam_asr_benchmarking created by me</a>.</p>

  <title>Chess is sometimes more entertaining than Cricket</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/chess.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Chess is occasionally more entertaining than cricket, and this notion was brought to light during the finals of the Global Chess League between Triveni Continental Kings and upGrad Mumbai Masters. As an Indian, this statement may seem controversial, but it is important to acknowledge that this is not always the case. Having witnessed the match between these two teams, I can confidently argue for the entertainment value of chess in certain instances.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ipz5yp3HzL4" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>While I personally struggle with playing chess and do not derive much enjoyment from it, I find watching chess matches and following the intriguing personalities in the chess world to be quite engaging. The particular match I am referring to was a team tournament with six players on each team, competing fiercely for their respective sides. The format involved the iconic board, two men’s boards, two women’s boards, and a prodigy board.</p>
<p>The tournament began with two rapid chess games, with each player having 15 minutes of time. In the first rapid game, Triveni Continental Kings emerged victorious while playing with the White pieces, but in the second rapid game, upGrad Mumbai Masters managed to win playing with the same color. Hence, the teams had to proceed into a blitz match with each player having only 5 minutes of time. Triveni Continental Kings played as White this time but unfortunately lost. Consequently, in a must-win game for Triveni Continental Kings playing as Black, they achieved the impossible under such pressure.</p>
<p>The tiebreaker resulted in a player-versus-player showdown, where three players from each team competed against one another. Surprisingly, all three matches ended in a draw, intensifying the level of suspense. The fate of the tournament ultimately rested on the final match between GM Jonas Bjerre from Denmark and GM Javokhir Sindarov. Remarkably, Sindarov had won all four of the matches played in the finals so far, adding an extra layer of excitement to this decisive game. The match concluded with Triveni Continental Kings emerging as the winners when Jonas defeated Sindarov with a checkmate, securing the victory for his team.</p>
<p>The tournament itself was well-organized, and as someone who has been following it for a few years, it was pleasing to witness its growing popularity. The event sponsors, Tech Mahindra, an Indian company, contributed to the grand prize of $500,000. This exemplifies the support of Indian companies like Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel who are increasingly involved in sponsoring major chess events. Moreover, India boasts talented prodigies like Gukesh, Arjun, Nihal, and Pragg, adding further excitement and intrigue to the world of chess.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while cricket holds a cherished place in the hearts of many, it is important to recognize that chess has its own unique and captivating qualities. The final match between Triveni Continental Kings and upGrad Mumbai Masters in the Global Chess League demonstrated the enthralling nature of the game. This particular encounter showcased the intense battles, strategic maneuvers, and moments of brilliance that chess has to offer. By expanding our perspective and appreciating the diverse aspects of sports and entertainment, we can fully embrace the thrilling world of chess alongside cricket.</p>

<p>The organizers of this meetup were fabulous. It was nice to interact with organizers like Mark, Richard, Riya, Subin, Devdutt etc. One of my friends Arun who was batch-mate at MEC took some nice photos of me speaking. It was a nice experience interacting with fellow speakers like Faiz Mohammed, Andrew Bastin and Maheshwaran. This meetup helped me to meet some new faces and reconnect with some familiar faces whom I knew since my college days. Overall attending the FOSS United Kochi Meetup was a great experience for me and felt the meetup is organized excellently.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Why is Malayalam more complex than other languages like Hindi, Marathi etc. While I understand the methodology of comparing type-to-token ratio (TTR), isn’t it possible that the dataset used for comparison may not include all the words of a particular language?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think whether just a privileged few people can do Machine Learning?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you think about Mojo, will it help in reducing the problem of few privileged people doing ML?</p></li>
<li><p>How much resources is required to fine tune Whisper models?</p></li>
<li><p>How much did it cost for you to do benchmarking in Malayalam?</p></li>
<li><p>Does a biriyani meal for a family in Singapore costs $30? (Apologies for my previous incorrect statement during the talk, where I mentioned the cost of one biriyani in Singapore might be about $30. This analogy was made to compare the cost of benchmarking models for Malayalam.)</p></li>
<li><p>I absoluted loved <code>whisper.cpp</code> because it’s able to provide timestamps as well, is it possible to implement timestamps in Malayalam as well?</p></li>

<p>All the folks who asked questions and made the session interactive, a big thank you from my side. As a speaker, it was the first time I was satisfied with myself for making the session interactive. My session demanded an interactive session as my slot was just after having a delicious lunch of biriyani. Also a special thanks to the volunteer who distributed the chocolotes to folks who answered my quiz questions. The organizers of event were fabulous, a special mention to names of people I remember at time of writing. Thank you Jithin, Karthik, Alaka, Theerthana, Aneeta who was always there to help. Also it was nice to meet FOSSMEC faculty in charge Sony mam.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vegam-whisper-family-of-models">Vegam Whisper Family of Models</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper">faster-whisper</a> which is a reimplementation of OpenAI’s Whisper model using CTranslate2 speeds upto 4 times faster than <code>openai/whisper</code> for the same accuracy while using less memory.</p>
<p>CTranslate2 supports various quantization formats and we have trained models for the following quantization formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>float16</li>
<li>int16</li>
<li>float8</li>
<li>int8_float8</li>
<li>No quantization</li>
</ul>
<p>For Malayalam, I used the best model in my benchmarking study ie <a href="https://huggingface.co/thennal/whisper-medium-ml">thennal/whisper-medium-ml</a> and converted into all possible quantization weights.</p>

<li>Pallakku is a Malayalam speech to text demo leveraging the model-weights of whisper family of models. It might be the first huggingface 🤗 spaces for Malayalam speech to text.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-behind-the-name-of-vegam-and-pallakku">What is behind the name of Vegam and Pallakku?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vegam is a Malayalam word which means speed.</li>
<li>Pallakku is a Malayalam word which means a palanquin. It is a vehicle which is carried by people.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an author of these work, I just wanted to say the meaning of these words doesn’t really have anything to do with the package. Vegam might not be the fastest Malayalam ASR model and Pallakku is named not to refer to the old colonial times. I just named it for the sake of naming it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-was-the-expereince-presenting-demos">How was the expereince presenting demos?</h2>
<p>Demo presentations are events where you can interact with people during the scheduled time. There was an evaluation panel with one of chief guests of the event <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-t-ramalingeswara-rao-784a903a/">Dr.&nbsp;T Ramalingeswara Rao</a> from TCS and one of the professors.</p>
<p>These sessions brought a hacker kind of vibe back to me. I was really happy to receive lot of curious questions and smiles received from folks who came to visit my demo presentation. I set up the demo in such a way that there was a wireless microphone and I would play a few audio files. They used to rate the output of the model.</p>
<p>Some of my professors who taught me in previous semesters like <a href="https://www.iiitkottayam.ac.in/#!/faculty/keshab">Dr.&nbsp;Keshab Nath</a> visited to see my demo and gave me suggestions. It was a nice vibe to interact with a bunch of BTech students in their second semester from Andhra Pradhesh. Even though they were not able to understand Malayalam, they just hung around and asked me questions :D.</p>

  <title>Learning how to install malayalam fonts</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I was working on Malayalam Speech to text models and the malayalam letters where not getting rendered properly. I was a bit irritated by it and I asked my friend <a href="https://thottingal.in/">Santhosh Thottingal</a> why <code>?</code> comes this way.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/malayalam_font2.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Malayalam rendered in Nirmala font.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Santhosh told me basically malayalam letters take 3 bytes compared to 1 byte for latin and if the text is broken in the middle of those 3 byte clusters, you will get invalid character and will be displayed as <code>?</code>.</p>
<p>Then he told me I was using one of the worst Malayalam fonts ie Nirmala by Microsoft which is the reason why I am seeing lot of rendering mistakes.</p>
<p>So I stopped working on Mayalam ASR models and thought of studying how to install Malayalam fonts.</p>
<p>I found personally two ways to install fonts and I want to share that here. There maybe another thousand different ways to install fonts which won’t be covered in this blogpost.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Installing with Malayalam Fonts - firefox plugins</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/malayalam-fonts/">plugin</a></li>
<li>Choose the fonts you want to use by selecting it firefox.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/firefox_plugin.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Installing on Microsoft Windows</li>
</ol>
<p>I just asked ChatGPT and it gave me the following steps to install fonts by SMC in Windows.</p>
<pre><code>To download SMC (Swathanthra Malayalam Computing) fonts for your Windows operating system, follow these steps:

1. Visit the SMC website: Go to the SMC website at https://smc.org.in/fonts/
using your web browser.

2. Choose the font: Browse through the available fonts and select the one you
want to download. SMC offers a variety of fonts for different purposes.

3. Download the font: Click on the download link or button associated with the
selected font. The font file will be downloaded to your computer as a
compressed (ZIP) file.

4. Extract the font: Locate the downloaded ZIP file and extract its contents.
Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" or use a third-party compression
tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the font files.

5. Install the font: After extracting the font files, double-click on the font file
with the extension ".ttf" or ".otf." A preview of the font will appear, and a dialog
box will open. Click on the "Install" button to install the font on your Windows system.

6. Font installation completion: Once the font is installed, you can start using it
in various applications such as word processors, graphic design software, or
web browsers. The font will be available for selection in the font menu
of compatible applications.

By following these steps, you should be able to download and install SMC fonts on your Windows
operating system. Remember to respect font licensing terms and only use the fonts
for their intended purposes.</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/malayalam_font3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Malayalam rendered in Manjari font."> <img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/malayalam_fonts/malayalam_font1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Malayalam rendered in Manjari font."></p>
<p>After all this I asked Santhosh whether I have installed Manjari font correctly and he said it’s correct. It’s not every day you get to ask the person who built that font whether I have installed the font correctly or not.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Note: For linux, all these fonts are preinstalled by default as it’s packaged as part of linux distros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am glad to have friends like <a href="https://thottingal.in/">Santhosh Thottingal</a> to ask questions like this. Santhosh has written lot of popular fonts in Malayalam like <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts/manjari">Manjari</a>, <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts/gayathri">Gayathri</a> and with his latest font <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts/nupuram">Nupuram</a> he has created almost 100+ fonts.</p>
<p>In my opinion SMC creates the best fonts in Malayalam and check their website section on <a href="https://smc.org.in/fonts">fonts to learn more</a>. If you are interested to learn more about Malayalam Computing I had previously written a <a href="../../../posts/2019/2019-07-30-Malayalam_computing.html">blogpost</a> which is just a highlight of talk given by Santhosh on this topic.</p>

  <title>Tributes to my first python teacher- Dear Jumana mam!</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/first_python_teacher/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In 2016 when I joined my BTech. for Computer Science, I was someone who didn’t love programming and CS was only subject I didn’t get A1 in my class 12 boards. In my semester I was taught Python by a wonderful teacher. She taught in a beginner friendly way and encouraged anyone to ask doubts.</p>
<p>She told us programming was not something to by-heart and there are multiple way to solve the same problem. One year back I called my teacher and thanked her. By then I had spoken in Pycon India twice as an expert in machine learning and core-python and was able to pay my bills by coding in Python. She was really happy about me and even asked me to send even the videos of my talks.</p>
<p>My dear Jumana mam passed away today. I was really blessed to have such a wonderful teacher.</p>

<p>I talked about Malayalam language and what makes it hard to work compared to other high resource languages like English. Then I highlighted some of the Malayalam models build during Whisper event and why I went ahead to benchmark these models. These models where benchmarked on two datasets mainly Common Voice and Malayalam Speech Corpus. I also shared more about the <a href="https://huggingface.co/models?other=vegam">Vegam Whisper model family</a> for making whisper models faster. Also I shared about Malayalam speech to text demo <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/kurianbenoy/Pallakku">Pallakku</a> which I am developing now with Vegam whisper weights.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I have been staying in Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Kottayam for the past three days in order to partake in my 4th semester M.Tech exams. I absolutely loved my stay in campus.</p>
<p>During my stay I had some interesting conversations with faculties, students who are doing PHD, UG and my fellow professional classmates who are pursuing MTech program. Some of these conversations were around latest advances of AI, AI hype etc.</p>
<p>The campus boasts excellent amenities. I am thankful to all the warm smiles and kindness received from everyone in campus specifically the ex-jawans who are working there.</p>

<p>I talked about what is OpenAI whisper and some of it’s amazing feature. I highlighted the importance of fine-tuning Whisper in low-resource language like Malayalam which is able to get almost 90% accuracy compared to -10% accuracy of OpenAI whisper model weights.

  <title>Four super powers of Jeremy Howard</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="about-podcast-interview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-podcast-interview">About Podcast interview</h2>
<p>I recently stumbled upon a podcast interview with Jeremy Howard hosted by one of my fast.ai friends Alex Strick van Linschoten, around 4 years back. I am a big fan of watching interview featuring Jeremy and some unique question were asked by the interviewer which I haven’t seen anyone asking.</p>
<p>I would defenitely recommend everyone to <a href="https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/2019/6/28/sources-and-methods-44-deep-learning-with-fastais-jeremy-howard">give a watch to the podcast interview</a>. In this interview, Jeremy shared four super powers which he learned over the years. I am going to briefly summarize them.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Spaced Repetition and learning how to learn</li>
</ol>
<p>Alex was very curious about how Jeremy learned chinese and his approach to learning. Jeremy answered as following:</p>
<p>I started learning Chinese not because I had any interest in Chinese, but because I was such a bad language learner in highschool. I did six months of French, I got 28% and I quit. When I wanted to dig into machine learning, I thought one of the things that might be better to understand was human learning, so I used myself as a subject. A hopeless subject. If I can come up with a way that even I can learn a language, that would be great. And to make sure that was challenging enough, I tried to pick the hardest language I could. So according to according to CIA guidelines, Arabic and Chinese are the hardest languages for people to pick up. Then I spent three months studying learning theory, and language learning theory, and then software to help me with that process.</p>
<p>It turns out that even I can learn Chinese. After a year of this - by no means a full time thing, an hour or two a day - I went to China to a top language learning program and based on the results of my exam got placed with all these language PhDs, and I thought wow. Studying smart is important. It’s all about how you do it.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition is such an easy thing that anyone can do, for free, you can start using it.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwH7bJibmdM">Jeremy’s amazing Anki talk</a></p>
<p>If you’re not using Anki, you’re many orders of magnitude less likely to remember a piece of vocab. So you come away like I did, thinking you can’t learn a language. But once you learn vocab, the rest is really not that hard. Don’t try to learn grammar, just spend all your time reading.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Recently, Rachel Thomas wrote a blog post about <a href="https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2023-02-21-anki/">How to remember anything</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Doing Regular exercises</li>
</ol>
<p>Ten years back Jeremy suffered a injury because of which he lost almost 6 months. After that he is doing regular yoga and exercises.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Note taking</li>
</ol>
<p>Lot of times Jeremy have seen whenever someone is discussing about a particular topic, or issue. Those who take the notes on the topic immediately are the one to follow up even later and perform much better. Exceptional people take a lot of notes. Less exceptional people assume they’re going to remember.</p>
<p>Taking notes in class is kind of a waste of time. I don’t really see the point of going to class most of the time honestly, it’s probably being videotaped</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Tenacity</li>
</ol>
<p>People who are successful practitioners in deep learning are the ones who have highest level of tenacity. He has found lot of people stopping midway and people who are world-class practitioners are always tenatious.</p>

<section id="two-critical-skills-in-ai-era" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-critical-skills-in-ai-era">Two critical skills in AI era</h2>
<p>The two critical skills going forward is:</p>
<ul>
<li>One is knowing how to use machine learning.</li>
<li>And the other is knowing how to interact with it and care for human beings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the latter one can’t be replaced by AI. The former one will gradually replace everything. Back in the early days of the commercial internet, being an internet expert was extremely useful and you could have a job as an internet expert and be in a company of internet experts, and sell yourself as an internet expert company. Today, very few people do that, because on the whole the internet is what it is, and there’s a relatively few number of people who need such a level of expertise that they can go in and change the way your router operates and such. I think we’re going to see the same thing with AI.</p>

  <title>🐦Learning more about birds and bird calls with Merlin app</title>

<p>I recently went for a bird watching adventure in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim_Ali_Bird_Sanctuary">Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary</a>, Thattekad Kerala, India. During that time, my guide was very proficient in identifying birds by just hearing sounds. In Salim Ali bird sanctuary itself there are almost 300 species of land birds and another 100+ species of water birds.</p>
<p>I was genuinely curious, how they learned about all these birds and memorized all these. This is when my guide talked about the Merlin app, which can help in learning more about various species of bird.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="buzz-about-chatgpt">Buzz about ChatGPT</h2>
<p>There has been a lot of buzz about GPT and ChatGPT in specific. Tom Scott, a youtuber recently published a video on how he used ChatGPT to fix a problem in his email backup program. He said it’s beginning of something new like how internet had literally changed everything 20-30 years back.</p>

<p>When I was writing this article, I forget the syntax of how to embed youtube videos in quarto markdown. I solved this issue by asking this <a href="https://quarto-bot.onrender.com/">question to Quarto Help Bot</a> which was made by <a href="https://hamel.dev/">Hamel Husain</a>.</p>
<p>I have seen chatbots, yet the way ChatGPT interacts and communicates is insane to be honest. You can ask it literally anything and these Large Language models are becoming incredibly useful. Hamel had used <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/">LangChain</a> which is like a framework for building applications with LLMs specifically for quarto.</p>

<p>Personally I have been following ML/AI for the past five years atleast. Last year really was hyped up. Initially there was this releases in DALL-E and it’s open source alternative Craiyon(then named DALLE mini) being viral. During this time so many trending things like Stable Diffusion, Whisper etc came.</p>
<p>One month back, I started seeing my cousins, parents etc. discussing about ChatGPT and how awesome it is. Some of the application apps like <a href="https://www.roamaround.io">Roamaround.ai</a> build on top of ChatGPT was being used. The final nail was last Sunday, when my grandfather called me to read about ChatGPT article in news.</p>
<p>I have seen people get hyped up about advances in ML. Yet I have never heard about the new technology being discussed by any of my family member like this. Hamel Hussein put this really well in his tweet about what is different in this wave of ML advances.</p>

</div>
<p>Hello everyone, I just thought of sharing my daily fitness routine which I have been following for the past 1 month. Previously I had written about <a href="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2020/2020-11-22-weightloss.html">How I lost almost 4Kgs in 3 weeks - my wegiht loss Journey</a>. I want to continue this journey, even though just after writing that post I gained a lot of kilos and I couldn’t follow everything I mentioned in that article.</p>
<p>So this time, I am with a new routine:</p>
<p>During morning I go to gym and do High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) for 30-45 minutes. In the gym I go, this usually consists of 8 stations of 3 minutes exercises followed by 30 seconds rest. The first four stations are vary day after day, followed by a challenge which changes every week. After this I do boxing, followed by two more stations of 3 minutes exercises which usually are floor exercises.</p>
<p>In evening I go for a walk for 45-60 minutes after my work. I usually try to walk almost 4 kilometers and monitor my progress in Strava app. I usually walk in the roads near my home till a paddy field and then return back. My usual pace is 4.5-6 km/h and I cover one kilometer in approximately 11-12 minutes.</p>
<p>Some of you might be wondering why I am sharing this, well I am sharing this as I want to document my fitness progress. Looking back, I myself can look at things I did and see how I progressed. I also want to share this with others who are interested.</p>

  <title>Attending MBIFL 2023, a literature festival</title>
  <dc:creator>Kurian Benoy</dc:creator>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/mbifl2023/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Since I am a frequent book purchaser from Mathrubhumi book, in January I got a notification to buy early bird tickets for <a href="https://www.mbifl.com/speakers-2023/">MBIFL 2023</a>. I immediately bought 4 day’s tickets to attend the literature festival. When it came to February, I realised due to some commitments at home and work, I couldn’t attend all the days of this literature festival despite having a ticket.</p>
<p>MBIFL had almost 300+ speakers, with famous speakers like Nobel prize winners, Brooker prize winners, politicians etc.</p>
<p>Yet I had just one wish. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benyamin_(writer)">Benyamin</a> is an author who has written lot of thriller novels like അൽ - അറേബ്യൻ നോവൽ ഫാക്‌ടറി and മുല്ലപ്പു നിറമുള്ള പകലുകൾ(which is a dual novel) along with the famous ആടു ജീവിതം(Goat Days). I just wanted to meet him in person and get an autograph on my copy of my favourite novel.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/mbifl2023/book.jpg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-left figure-img" width="300"></p>
<figcaption>My favourite novel</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I travelled early morning from my house and reached the venue by almost 10:30 AM. During this time, there was a conversational session about പ്രവാസിയുടെ അക്ഷരകാലം with P Sreeramkrishan, Benyamin, Shabini Vasudev and KV Mohan Kumar. After the session, there was a huge fan base to meet author Benyamin. I first went to get a signature from another author KV Mohan Kumar in the panel, and then waited in the queue to get a signature from Benyamin.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/mbifl2023/benyamin_session.jpg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-left figure-img" width="300"></p>
<figcaption>Session on പ്രവാസിയുടെ അക്ഷരകാലം</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>After lot of books were signed by Benyamin which was bought by his fans with some of his famous works like ആടു ജീവിതം, മാന്തളിരിലെ ഇരുപത് കമ്മ്യൂണിസ്ററ് വർഷങ്ങൾ, അൽ - അറേബ്യൻ നോവൽ ഫാക്‌ടറി. I got my copy also signed with a salutation of snehattode(with love). I just asked my favourite author does a person named Sameera Parveen who was a character in Jasmine Days really exist or not. Benyam answered that it’s a mixture of multiple people who he had seen in his life, yet there is no one such person who doesn’t exist as Sameera Parveen like Najeeb in ആടു ജീവിതം.</p>
<p>My mission was just completed in one hour and I got a few more signatures like Shabini Vasudev who is an author from Bahrain and from Vinu V John, who is the star anchor of Asianet news(who kindly reminded me he is not famous to be giving autograph).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-left">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/mbifl2023/book_signature.jpg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-left figure-img" width="300"></p>
<figcaption>All the signature I got</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>After that, I attended the talk with Aparna Balamurali and Captian GR Gopinath. Shashi Tharoor talked about his book Pride, Prejudice and Punditry. Seeing Tharoor answer a question to a student reminded me of India’s former people’s president APJ. I wish him all the success as a politician.</p>
<p>One of the last sessions I attended that day was by Polish author Justi Guziak on Know yourself to express yourself. This session talked about improvising and was a hands-on workshop to learn this art. During the session, the speakers gave me a chit with the question <code>what was the best gift you have ever received?</code>. This question was to be asked to someone who was at the other end of the audience. I gave my question and Janaki who was from Thiruvananthapuram told me the best gift she ever received was a dog she received when she was in her 7th standard. This dog has been living with her for the past 15 years as a constant when she went through her school, then college and even after her marriage. Another situation which was given during the workshop was to convince Mr Karun to give something valuable in his hand. After a lot of convincing, I was able to share the lunch with Karun.</p>
<p>That winded up MBIFL 2023, a literature festival for me a data scientist who doesn’t have anything related to it. It was cool to interact and meet with so many cool people. I am looking forward to MBIFL 2024 soon…</p>

</div>
<p><em>Update 1(March 5, 2023)</em></p>
<p>I found a very cool video in 360 degree which showed how the MBIFL 2023 venue atmosphere is. It was a very cool video and I thought of including this also with this blogpost.</p>

  <title>Welcome To My Quarto Website</title>

<p><img src="https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2023/welcome/thumbnail.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is my first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome everyone to my new blog.</p>
<p>I have been wanting for a long time to unify <a href="https://github.com/kurianbenoy/ml-blog">my existing Machine learning blog</a> based on fast-pages together with <a href="https://github.com/kurianbenoy/kurianbenoy.github.io/tree/4b5246ada3190dbdd73dc96d266a5ade7ef078a3">my main blog website</a>.</p>
<p>The unification process is a bit challenging:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All my previous blog post in main website was written with <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll">beautiful jekyll</a> format using markdown.</li>
<li>Need support for jupyter-notebook, which beautiful jekyll doesn’t support</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where Quarto comes as a saviour. It has wide support for various formats like markdown, jupyter notebook, rmarkdown. The goal, JJ and team is looking to have a single source of publication is really interesting. I was already familiar with nbdev with few of the projects I previously made.</p>
<p>I converted all of my existing blog post in markdown to fastpages markdown format. Then I leveraged <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/migrating.html">nbdev 1 migration scripts</a> to move it to quarto.</p>

  <title>How well does CLIP models classify corn seeds?</title>
  <link>https://kurianbenoy.com/posts/2022/2022-11-07-clip_experiments.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The OpenAI CLIP model are really impressive and how it’s a foundation for stuff like stable diffusion is awesome. The thing about CLIP models which I am most impressed by is the wide range of applications it be used for like <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/YiYiXu/it-happened-one-frame-2">Semantic Video Search</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP#zero-shot-prediction">Zero shot image classification</a>, <a href="https://wandb.ai/pcuenq/photo-finder/reports/Creating-a-Semantic-Search-Engine-for-My-Photos--VmlldzoyMDE2NzQ3">searching images in your gallery</a> etc.</p>
<p>I recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020">started reading CLIP paper</a> and paper claims to have very high accuracy in image clssification accuracy. To test that claim, I thought of trying it out that in a kaggle competition I had recently participated.</p>
<p>The kaggle competition is a Corn image classification competition and is asking to classify images of corn seeds into following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>pure</li>
<li>broken</li>
<li>discolored</li>
<li>silkcut</li>
</ul>
<p>I used <code>open_clip</code>, an open source implementation of CLIP which is having higher accuracy compared to model weights released by OpenAI.</p>
<p>Even after using one of the best accuracy CLIP models available( ViT-H-14), it got me a classification accuracy score of 27.95% in private LB whereas Resnet or Convnext models could have given easily above 75% score.</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Model</th>
<th>Public LB</th>
<th>Private LB</th>
<th>Notebook link</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ViT-B-32-quickgelu</td>
<td>0.16666</td>
<td>0.18397</td>

<tr class="even">

<td>0.28591</td>
<td>0.27955</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>When I shared this results in twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/YiYiMarz">YiYi Xu</a> suggested to try out <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP#linear-probe-evaluation">linear probing in CLIP</a>. She mentioned that, I was not comparing apples to apples, as I was using a zero-shot model with CLIP to compared with a fine tuned model of convnext. In order to level up, I should use linear probing which is using training data to kind of fine tune with a logistic regression model leveraging features in CLIP model.</p>
<p>Based on this, I leveraged using linear probing on the dataset. As a result my updated result are the following:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Model</th>
<th>Public LB</th>
<th>Private LB</th>
<th>Notebook link</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Zero Shot ViT-B-32-quickgelu</td>

<tr class="odd">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-was-paddy-competiton-for-me">How was Paddy competiton for me?</h2>
<p>This competition is still ongoing at the time of writing. Yet during one month break during which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM">Jeremy’s live-coding sessions</a> were held. I got some time to play with Paddy disease classification competition with this competition with other fastai friends also.</p>
<p>At the start of lesson 7, Jeremy said some kind words to Nick and me which can be found in below youtube video. I am extremely lucky to learn from such a great teacher. Without these four notebooks and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM">Jeremy’s live-coding sessions</a>, it wouldn’t have been possible.</p>

<p>I am not going in detail on this lesson, as I feel the introduction notebooks have covered everything so well. So signing off early this time.</p>
