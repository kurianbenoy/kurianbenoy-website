- <span style="color:red">I think Whisper^[<span style="color:black">According to [research paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf) p.2, the name Whisper is an abbrevation for WSPR: `Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition`.</span>] is the most `under-rated model` released by OpenAI.</span>
- <span style="color:green">It was open-sourced on September 21, 2022 by releasing the inference code and pre-trained model weights.</span>

## About OpenAI Whisper Model

- Whisper is a computer program which can listen to people talking and write down what they say. <span style="color:red">(Automatic Speech Recognition Model)</span>
- Whisper can understand people speaking different languages and can even translate what they say into English. <span style="color:green">(Supports transcription and translation to English)</span>

## Malayalam is a complex language

## Whisper Event

- <span style="color:red">HuggingFace Team conducted a whisper fine tuning event for 2 weeks from 5th December 2022 to 19th December 2022. The results were out on 23rd December 2022.</span>
- <span style="color:blue">The goal was to to fine-tune the Whisper model to build state-of-the-art speech recognition systems in the languages of our choice ðŸ—£ </span>

## Malayalam models produced in Whisper Event

- <span style="color:red">For the language Malayalam, the results are as follows:</span>

## Winning models in Malayalam in Whisper Event {.nonincremental}

- <span style="color:red">The winning model for Common voice</span>: `thennal/whisper-medium-ml`
- <span style="color:blue">The winning model for Fleurs</span>: `parambharath/whisper-small-ml`

## I was not convinced

- <span style="color:red">Didn't trust the Hugging Face way of evaluating models.</span>

## Objective of my benchmarking

- <span style="color:red">To test whether 10% WER was possible in available academic datasets.</span>

**Datasets**

- <span style="color:blue">Common Voice 11 malayalam subset</span>
- <span style="color:blue">SMC Malayalam Speech Corpus</span>

## Metrics for evaluating ASR models

- ASR evaulation relies on comparission between <span style="color:red">ground-truth</span> and <span style="color:red">ASR output</span>.
- <span style="color:blue">Common metrics for ASR evaluation which are popular and good enough^[<span style="color:black">According to Rethinking Evaluation in ASR: Are our models robust enough? by Likhomanenko T, Xu, Q., Pratap etc.</span>] are</span> :

<span style="color:green">1. Word Error Rate(WER)</span>

<span style="color:green">2. Character Error Rate(CER)</span>

## I wanted to build something new

- <span style="color:red">New github project for [Malayalam ASR Benchmarking](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/malayalam_asr_benchmarking)</span>

![Time for a new adventure](../fossasia2023/adventure_talk.jpg)

## Methadology for benchmarking

1. <span style="color:red">Create as a python library so further whisper-based transformer models can be benchmark.</span>
2. <span style="color:blue">Calculate WER, CER, model size and time taken to benchmark the model for the listed datasets.</span>
3. <span style="color:green">Build a reproducible approach, so results of benchmarking is stored as dataset.</span>


## Benchmarked models

- <span style="color:red">Started with 6 fine-tuned models in Malayalam and compared it with [6 model versions released by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper).</span>

1. thennal/whisper-medium-ml
2. parambharat/whisper-tiny-ml
3. parambharat/whisper-base-ml
4. parambharat/whisper-small-ml
5. anuragshas/whisper-large-v2-ml
6. DrishtiSharma/whisper-large-v2-malayalam

## Future Ideas for Benchmarking

- <span style="color:red">Something very similar to OpenLLM Leaderboard with results of latest malayalam speech models.</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Should include results for Kaldi, Meta's MMS, Wav2Vec etc.</span>

## Conclusion

::: {.incremental}
- <span style="color:red">In Malayalam we have achieved phenomenal results for fine tuned whisper models.
- <span style="color:blue">The best model is: `thennal/whisper-medium-ml`
- <span style="color:green">I think their seems to be a good ASR model suitable for production use-cases.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">You can also do it in your own language especially if it is a low resource language.</span>
