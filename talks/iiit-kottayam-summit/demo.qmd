## I was not convinced

<span style="color:red">I was sceptical about the winning models becuase of</span>:

::: {.incremental}

1. Achieving 10% WER in Malayalam is astonishing.
2. In Malayalam there is not even a single yard stick to compare. Most of
previous works were done in proprietary datasets and not open-sourced.
3. Malyalam is a [morpohologically complex language](https://kavyamanohar.com/documents/tsd_morph_complexity_ml.pdf). So even achieving 30% WER
is a big deal.

## I was not convinced {.scrollable}

4. Didn't trust the Hugging Face way of evaluating models.

## I wanted to build something new

- <span style="color:red">New github project for [Malayalam ASR Benchmarking](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/malayalam_asr_benchmarking)</span>

## Benchmarked models

- <span style="color:red">Started with 6 fine-tuned models in Malayalam and compared it with [6 model versions released by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper).</span>

1. thennal/whisper-medium-ml
2. parambharat/whisper-tiny-ml
3. parambharat/whisper-base-ml
4. parambharat/whisper-small-ml
5. anuragshas/whisper-large-v2-ml
6. DrishtiSharma/whisper-large-v2-malayalam

## Results on benechmarking in Common Voice dataset

## End Goal

- <span style="color:red">Something very similar to OpenLLM Leaderboard with results of latest malayalam speech models.</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Should include results for Kaldi, Wav2Vec, Whisper, MMS etc.</span>

## vegam-whisper-medium ml model and Pallakku

## Inspired by

::: {.incremental}
- <span style="color:red">[faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.</span>
- <span style="color:blue">This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.</span>

## CTranslate2

- <span style="color:red">It had this utility for converting any `whisper` based model to faster-whisper like models.</span>

```shell
ct2-transformers-converter \
 --model openai/whisper-tiny \
 --output_dir whisper-tiny-ct2
```

## Vegam Whisper models released

- <span style="color:red">I used `thennal/whisper-medium-ml` to convert it to faster-whisper based models for Malayalam:</span>

1. [kurianbenoy/vegam-whisper-medium-ml-fp16](https://huggingface.co/kurianbenoy/vegam-whisper-medium-ml-fp16)

## Pallakku

- <span style="color:red">Pallakku is a Malayalam speech to text demo leveraging the model-weights of vegam-whisper-medium-ml.</span>
- Now hosted as:

1. [ðŸ¤— spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kurianbenoy/Pallakku)
2. GPU-based microservice (coming soon.)
