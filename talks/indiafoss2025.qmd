## Why even Synthetic data?

- The amount of real datasets is really low. 

## Providence of Synthic data

## Cost aspect?

## Proposed Method for Synthethic Speech Dataset (1/2)

**Input Source (Malayalam Text)**
  - Directly start with text (from dataset, Wikipedia, government docs, OER, etc.).
  - No speech-to-text conversion needed.
**Text Preprocessing**
  - Clean the text: remove special characters, normalize spellings, handle punctuation.
**Malayalam Text Processing**
  - Tokenize words, handle grammar-specific features, normalize Unicode characters.
**Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) Conversion**
  - Convert Malayalam letters (graphemes) into their sounds (phonemes).
  - Example: "കേരളം" → /keːɾɐɭɐm/

## Proposed Method for Synthethic Speech Dataset (2/2)

**Speech Synthesis (TTS)**
  - Map phonemes to synthetic speech representation.
  - Uses models like IndicTTS, IndicF5, XTTS.
**Generate Spectrogram (Acoustic Model)**
  - Convert phoneme sequence into a spectrogram (visual sound representation).
**Vocoder → Convert to Speech**
  - Convert spectrogram into natural audio waveforms.

## Proposed Model for Synthethic Speech Dataset
  - IndicF5: Open-source Indic TTS, supports Indian scripts.
  - XTTS-v2 – Multilingual, high-quality cross-lingual TTS.
  - FreeVC24 / Voice Cloning – Generate diverse speakers.

## Domains used for Text Data
  - News Websities
  - Wikipedia
  - Literature and Books
  - OpenSubtitles.org
  - Crowdsourced Text Datasets

## Public Dataset created
