Mario Jason Braganza - Write two new blogpost everyweek 

Q) Hi Linus, yesterday I was thinking how do you effectively manage the process of writing a long article like the recent one about your personal workflow tools which you got the cue when you are in Iceland during march.Also at the same time, you have been consistently managing the rhythm by publishing weekly one article.

ans) To be honest, I don't really keep myself to a strict rhythm. I have a queue of ideas I want to write about (at the moment it's about 6 differnet topics / prompts) And when I get a chance to write, I'll sit down and try to crank out a good draft in 2-3 hours. That tools/workflows post was longer than my usual, but most of it was drafted in one sitting (though I've jot down / developed the ideas for a while obviously).

I think for me, there's quite a bit of time between (1) having some idea and (2) being ready to write about it, and most of that process is either reading about related topics online or bringing it up when I'm talking to someone smart, and seeing what they think are good ideas / what they think are confusing. And then when my thoughts feel organized enough, I sit down and outline/write it in one go usually.

For workflow post I'd been talking with lots of friends/coworkers about tools for a while and I also asked on Twitter what people wanted to her about my home-grown tools. So I took those and turned it into a high level outline (whcih is basically the table of contents you see on the post) and then expanded on each thing.
