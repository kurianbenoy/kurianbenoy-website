Dgplug conduct awesome FOSS training every year. I have decided to participate
this years training. The following are some of the questions which have been
answered during training by experts here.

**mbuf, what are the basics Industry expect from a Bachelors student?**

```
<mbuf> django_master, I cannot answer for the industry, but, there are two schools of thought that you should be familiar with


<mbuf> django_master, there is the cathedral style of working, where you do what your managers ask you to do, and ask no questions; most of the service companies follow this model


<mbuf> django_master, there is also the bazaar model in lot of start-up like companies, where they have the FLOSS culture, where you question everything and see how to improve thingns


<mbuf> django_master, there are few large enterprises, where small teams work in a bazaar model too


<mbuf> django_master, to understand the differences, you need to read http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/


<mbuf> next


<mbuf> django_master, basically your basics should be strong, attitude to learn


<mbuf> django_master, if you want to survive and work in FLOSS companies


<mbuf> django_master, again, it is important to work in a project that interests you, than be stuck in the wrong company

```

**I get stuck when solving harder problems and bugs that take about 4-5 days effort. How to show perseverance when solving bigger problems and when mentors continuosly get back to you with comments?**


```
<mbuf> django_master, this is where the communication guidelines come into play


<mbuf> django_master, you need to describe all the approaches you have taken to solve the problem or bug, document it, maybe in a blog post, and send it for review


<mbuf> django_master, and if the mentors find that you have really put in the effort, then they may guide you or give you pointers


<mbuf> django_master, nobody said life is easy; if you are afraid, or scared to experiment, learn and try out things, you are in the wrong industry

<mbuf> django_master, there is a reason why engineers are paid well :) (to solve hard problems)
```

**Have you given any talk proposal for Pycon India?**

```

<sayan> django_master: nope!


<sayan> I'm not working much on Python these days


<django_master> Oh you are working infrastructure track right?


<sayan> django_master: Yup


<kushal> django_master, I would love to, but, my proposals do get rejected with strange columns over many years


<sayan> kushal: push harder?


<django_master> kushal, What if you are not getting selected. How can anyone get selected for Pycon India


<kushal> sayan, whom should I push?


<sayan> Try to find something which is not on the internet?


<django_master> kushal, weren't you a speaker last time?


<sayan> kushal: you just need to work harder?


<kushal> sayan, or like a senior software engineer
```


**Everyone here talks about importance of blogging. How frequently we should blog and on what topics?**

```
<mbuf> django_master, Stephen King (the writer) says the ratio of reading to writing is 10:1


<mbuf> django_master, if you read 10x, then you will write a 1x piece


<django_master> mbuf, amazing answer


<mbuf> django_master, writing is an important habit in our culture, and we want everyone to write, get it reviewed by others as well


<mbuf> django_master, it is useful documentation not only for you, but, for others as well


<mbuf> I will encourage every one to read this Stephen King's book "On Writing" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing:_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft


<mbuf> he talks a lot about writing fiction, but, the practices are very good; I will not give away the answer, but, will let you all read it


<mbuf> Try to write at least one blog post per week; that is a good number


<mbuf> of course, if you are working on a massive piece, you can take your time on it


<mbuf> documentation is as important as writing code, and we emphasize that a lot; so, if you have good writing habits, you will do well here andtra in life; otherwise, start working on it
```
