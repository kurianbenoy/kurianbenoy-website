Today @Aman Arora shared four blogpost ideas. Just sharing here for everyone:

1. Write about what `untar_data` method is doing under the hood?
2. Write about what is `fastai foundation class L` is doing. What are the unique features of this special list part of fastai core library?
3. Write about `regex` which is a pretty useful library, and write on what all cool things you can do with it.
4. Write about `cross_entropy_loss` .
