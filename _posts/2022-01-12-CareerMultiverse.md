This guide has been build based on [Amuldotexe Career Multiverse guide](https://www.figma.com/file/vj04DNzGZknuWSJ2ILJbtp/amuldotexe-Career-Multiverse-Case-Study-20211027?node-id=0%3A1)


Things which are important to me:

1. Gain mastery
2. Learn new things and feel smart
3. Freely explore something on my own(without harming anyone in my family like Chacha)
4. Connect with friends & family
5. Explore new environments


### Evidential Life

- Net worth : 5.5 pa
- Designation: Datascientist
- Reputation of company: low
- Where you went for Vacation?: Nowhere
- Which kind of house do you live in & what rent you pay: 2 floor large size home with Appa & Amma & no -rent

### Experiential Life

Personal:

- Do you feel secure about your financial future: 

It's now in a okayish state as I don't want to spent my money on anything now. My burning rate is approx. now 20K per month (6000+ college fees + stuff).
If I leave my job, it will be difficult to pay my college fees. I need to pay almost Rs 374000 to complete my MTECH (this is my only due amount to be found for next 3 years)
+ my monthy burning rate

- Do you really enjoy your vacations?

I am totally doubtful of this aspect, as I have never taken one. Once I took 2-3 days of leaves, usually it was not so productive.

- Do you enjoy your house or community?

TBH I have a place on my own. But the community is like marriage after age of 27 only, and very other important things as well

Carrer Specific:

Hours per week - 60
Stess level of job - less
Enjoyment level in job - getting less and less

SDT Patterns (Feel part of community, need autonomy etc.)

Am I working on the tech stack I like: (Not exactly, I like to try out FastAPI etc)
Remote nature: prefer it more
Asynchrnous nature of job: Yes prefer it, I don't like anyone to push me on crucial decisions and deliver stuff on time

**Level 3**

1 year goals:

- Become from mediumly proficient in Python to being advanced user
- Then make my DSA knowledge from 20/100 to 70/100

5 year goals:

- Become a senior Software engineer
- Build an open source project with 1000+ stars
- Earn 50LPA
- Travel 5 countries

10 year goals:
- Become a principal developer or be in like CTO role
- Work in Faang company probably
- Until 10 yrs being a full stack developer gives you more opportunities Kurian to explore and be in a good position(Sankar)

How can I achieve my goals?





See Salil pattern of progress:

```
 I went from having no offers to 4 high paying offers, all of which were 3x to 10x the average package in my college.

This wouldn't have been possible had I not stood out from the college crowd.

Here are a few things that worked for me. 

1. I learnt on my own.
Since my freshman year, I spent more time learning on the internet than in the classrooms. The internet allowed me to learn what I'm passionate about. 

2. Focused on the skills that mattered to me.
I didn't get carried away by trends and hypes. Instead, I focused on improving my frontend development, UI/UX and leadership skills. 

3. Built a lot of projects
I built more client projects than personal projects.

Though this allowed me to build a reputation & skills and earn handsome money, I would suggest building personal projects over client projects as the latter comes with long term responsibilities. 

4. Surrounded me with the right people.
Can't stress enough how important this is, especially if you are from tier 3 college. Being with people better than me helped me grow and learn a lot. I met most of them on Twitter or through open-source programs, hackathons & fellowships 

5. Knowing my worth.
I would have accepted my very first offer had I not known my worth. It was a pretty good package, probably the best in the history of my college. But I knew I could do better and was aware of what I brought to the table. 

But that's not the whole story. I discussed my offers with my friends who were already doing better than me and they too influenced my decisions. So you see, being with the right people helps. 

6. Internships and fellowships.
I did a lot of internships. And honestly, each of my internships lasted more than the relationships these days. Internships coupled with client projects put a lot of weight on the experience section in my resume. My skills improved a lot. 

Fellowships are the best place to network with ambitious and driven people. I got to learn the latest stuff from the best mentors in a fun way. You should definitely check out Devfolio fellowships. 

7. Result-driven work
Hard work without positive results can be very disappointing. I always started things with an end goal in mind and then worked hard to reach the goal. This worked pretty well for me as I achieved a lot by following this strategy. 

These are some of the things that helped me stand out from the rest and hopefully, it will help you too.
