Things which are important to me:

1. Gain mastery
2. Learn new things and feel smart
3. Freely explore something on my own(without harming anyone in my family like Chacha)
4. Connect with friends & family
5. Explore new environments


### Evidential Life

- Net worth : 5.5 pa
- Designation: Datascientist
- Reputation of company: low
- Where you went for Vacation?: Nowhere
- Which kind of house do you live in & what rent you pay: 2 floor large size home with Appa & Amma & no -rent

### Experiential Life

Personal:

- Do you feel secure about your financial future: 

It's now in a okayish state as I don't want to spent my money on anything now. My burning rate is approx. now 20K per month (6000+ college fees + stuff).
If I leave my job, it will be difficult to pay my college fees. I need to pay almost Rs 374000 to complete my MTECH (this is my only due amount to be found for next 3 years)
+ my monthy burning rate

- Do you really enjoy your vacations?

I am totally doubtful of this aspect, as I have never taken one. Once I took 2-3 days of leaves, usually it was not so productive.

- Do you enjoy your house or community?

TBH I have a place on my own. But the community is like marriage after age of 27 only, and very other important things as well

Carrer Specific:

Hours per week - 60
Stess level of job - less
Enjoyment level in job - getting less and less
