Redash is an open-source business intelligence tool used for creating interactive dashboards and to create meaningful visualizations. Redash is designed to enable anyone – regardless of their technical knowledge – to harness the power of data big and small. We have leveraged the power of Redash to build formsflow.ai, a powerful open-source forms workflow analytics solution framework.

#### Why we love Redash?

We love Redash because of its powerful features. Yet that is not the only reason we chose Redash as our analytics platform for formsflow.ai. If you look at the market of Business Intelligence tools, there are a lot of choices, both proprietary and open-source. Even in open-source space, there are a lot of products like Apache Superset, Dash (based on Plotly), RawGraphs, etc which are feature-rich and powerful.
Another reason we use Redash is that it supports the authentication method of OpenID Connect(OIDC) needed for formsflow.ai with SAML authentication. Also, it is very light-weight to use for our entire application compared to other providers. Lastly, Redash is open-source and has a stable community to help out any time.

#### How to use Redash?

The process of how to use Redash is well documented in official docs. Some of the basic steps for working with Redash are:

1. **Add Data sources** – You can connect with about 30+ supported data sources mentioned in docs from the browser itself.

2. **Write Queries** – Once data is connected we can write queries. It’s always ideal to create individual queries for the necessary visualizations. Writing queries is a data preparation step to process data for visualization.

3. **Create Visualizations** – There are a variety of visualizations supported in Redash. Ten different categories of visualization can be created with just drag and select features to visualize from the queried data. Redash supports visualization types like BoxPlot, Counter, BarCharts, Sunburst, Sankey, Word Cloud, line chart, Area charts, etc. To learn how to create visualizations checkout Redash visualization docs.

4. **Create dashboards** – We can create interactive dashboards that can be embedded anywhere and shared with colleagues easily. The queries can be refreshed periodically as more data comes in.
