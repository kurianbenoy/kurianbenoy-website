So my weight loss journey wasn't a quick fix journey. During my school days, I was having quite normal weight. Yet during my
class 12 board exams, I slowly started gaining weight. It was apparently obivious by the time I was in college, I was getting 
overweight than quite usual. It continued all throughout my college years in same way throughout my college days.

So my plan to reverse this came from an advise from a adult who recommended me to slowly lose weight and asked me whether my
plan was to reach the 100 kg. This made me thoughtful and during the lockdown month, I thought about changing in the mind.
The inspiration was from a CTDS episode where the author told about the importance on taking gambles and reaching his goals.
It was a huge inspiration, and on the day of watching episode, my cousin brother invited me to decrease my weight with 
exercise using practises with dumbles. As a effort my part, I promised him to give a biryani, if I lost 6 kilograms in a 
month(in July). 

In a  month, I made better progress and started losing weight by exercising using dumbels and doing yogo daily. The daily routine
was doing yogo for 20 minutes and working out with Dumbels for another 25 minutes. The weight slowly started decreasing,
and I was very happy. All went for first 2-3 weeks, yet after that it didn't go so good. I was in range 80 kgs very quickly from about
83 kg, yet but then I got a small health issue when I fainted one of the day. So it didn't work very well for me.

One of the biggest takeaways for me , was I moved away from heavy exercises with dumbels to other exercises like walking daily,
doing badminton etc. I enjoy these activities a lot. I now try to regulary walk daily like 5000 steps, which I enjoy a lot while
listening to my favourite podcast episodes. I am glad to have the previelage of enough land owned by us itself to walk daily without
going into public spaces.

The weight remained almost constant during this period which was in the range 79 to 82 range. During this time, I started a new habit
of drinking tea without sugar. Regarding sugar, I now understand it's very injurious to health after watching The Sugar film.

It's a cause of obesity, and eating no soft drink, health drink can help reduce your weight. I haven't followed it fully, yet reduced
my intake a lot after this small change.
<forgot another idea>

I recently tweeted I will be walking 360 kms by the end of this year.

Recently, I started another sprint encouraged my Vellaunty to reduce weight. It was a three week hectic diet to reduce my diet by avoiding
Rice(daily food) + snacks(which includes in my daily evening routine). The result is amazing so far, I reduced my weight from 81.6 range to 
my current weight of 77.5 weight at the lowest range. So far so great.
