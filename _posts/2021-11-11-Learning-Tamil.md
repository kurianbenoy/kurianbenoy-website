Thanks to [Sankar M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankara-raman-m-a516b295/), I have been learning a bit of Tamil.

A few words I learned so far are:

```
How are you? - Ninkal Yeppadi irikkengal
I am fine - Nannayi irrikenga
brother - Anna
Sister - Akka
Really good(adipoli) - Sema 
Kallai Vanakkam - Good Morning
Nandri  - Thank you
Romba / Nerya - More
nal - days
romba nal achu eppadi irikkenga -
```

In malayalam, we have different slangs and it's obviously difficult to understand few of words like
Mema - which means mothers sister in Kottayam side. In my place, the same words we use Kunnaunty, Vellaunty etc.

I will be adding more words, as I learn more tamil.

Signing off,
