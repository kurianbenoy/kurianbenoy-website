- Aman decided to cover only the Chapter 2 during the session.
- As a group, Aman asked to check out the  questionnares in Chapter. Always asks your questions
- Dataloaders is something which passes the function one by one is called function. Fastai Train dataloader and validation dataloader

- X is always called independent variable and Y which is label to predict is called dependent variable.
In a datablock:
 1. Get dependent & independent variables
2. Get image files
3. Splitters(train and valid dataset)
get-parent-label, it's just finding parent folder and getting it's folder
Splitter is basically splitting to validation and train images. It helps me a lot (answered personally for me)

- Padding Images and using things. The black method for padding, are not really good. Squishing images, is not how it's really is. They both are suboptimal way of doing things.
According to book, Random Resized Crop, it's way better that any other images. It still sees full images, yet it sees completely over 5-10 epochs.
- In ImageDataLoaders from-name-func, internally calling Dataloaders.
