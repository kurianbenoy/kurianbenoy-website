If you already don't know what is Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS). Please checkout the below videos:

You may have understood atleast the following:

It's a mechanism to allow communication of one resource to another resource in a different domain. It sets the header, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
which can have the following values - `*, <origin>, null`.

To implement CORS simply, there are a bunch of different ways:

## To use flask-cors library

flask-cors is a library which is like an extension used for handling CORS. It helps in enabling CORS in multiple ways like:

Defualt usage with default argument inorder to allow CORS for all domains

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route("/")
def helloWorld():
  return "Hello, cross-origin-world!"
{% endhighlight %}


## To use a decarotor on your own

{% highlight python linenos %}
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from datetime import timedelta
from flask import make_response, request, current_app
from functools import update_wrapper


def crossdomain(
    origin=None,
    methods=None,
    headers=None,
    expose_headers=None,
    max_age=21600,
    attach_to_all=True,
    automatic_options=True,
    credentials=False,
):
    """
    http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/56/
    """
    if methods is not None:
        methods = ", ".join(sorted(x.upper() for x in methods))
    if headers is not None and not isinstance(headers, str):
        headers = ", ".join(x.upper() for x in headers)
    if expose_headers is not None and not isinstance(expose_headers, str):
        expose_headers = ", ".join(x.upper() for x in expose_headers)
    if not isinstance(origin, str):
        origin = ", ".join(origin)
    if isinstance(max_age, timedelta):
        max_age = max_age.total_seconds()

    def get_methods():
        if methods is not None:
            return methods

        options_resp = current_app.make_default_options_response()
        return options_resp.headers["allow"]

    def decorator(f):
        def wrapped_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if automatic_options and request.method == "OPTIONS":
                resp = current_app.make_default_options_response()
            else:
                resp = make_response(f(*args, **kwargs))
            if not attach_to_all and request.method != "OPTIONS":
                return resp

            h = resp.headers

            h["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = origin
            h["Access-Control-Allow-Methods"] = get_methods()
            h["Access-Control-Max-Age"] = str(max_age)
            if credentials:
                h["Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"] = "true"
            if headers is not None:
                h["Access-Control-Allow-Headers"] = headers
            if expose_headers is not None:
                h["Access-Control-Expose-Headers"] = expose_headers
            return resp

        f.provide_automatic_options = False
        return update_wrapper(wrapped_function, f)

    return decorator
{% endhighlight %}

Personally I will prefer to use this implementation, if my use case was to just enable CORS instead 
of importing a third-party library. Future Kurian would definitely like to implement things on his own way
rather than relying on third party libraries only as required. 

Let's look into some of headers used in this method:

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: It indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin.
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: It is used in response to a preflight request which includes the Access-Control-Request-Headers to indicate which HTTP headers can be used during the actual request.
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: It specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resource in response to a preflight request.

To use this decorator, just import it and use it over any resources in Flask as following:

```
@app.route("/predict/tree", methods=["POST", "GET"])
@crossdomain(origin='*')
def predict_tree():
```

Yet both the above approaches are defaulting to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin : `*` or `<origin>`. 

> Yet our issue in plain english is to whitelist multiple origins. For that we need to check if the requested resource which is
planning to shared is part of our whitelisted multiple origin. If yes, set header `Access-control-allow-Origin` with that requested resource url.

### Trying to implement with request object in flask

Using request.base_url, you can access the URL. I was expecting it to be used to set Access-Control-Allow-Origins by checking if the requested
url is part of whitelisted URLs. 

### Trying to implement with flask-cors library

In [configuration docs of flask-cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html). It's defined that Origin can be set as a string,
List, regex pattern too. When passed as a string, the entire string of whitelist urls was being set for the header Access-control-Allow-Origins.

### Trying to implement with app.after_request method

[This was originally inspired from solution proposed here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42681311/flask-access-control-allow-origin-for-multiple-urls)

```code
@app.after_request
def cors_origin(response):
    white_origin = ['https://kurianbenoy.com', 'https://beautifuljekyll.com/']
    if white_origin == "*":
        response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = "*"
    else:
        for url in white_origin:
        if (request.headers.get('Origin')):
            response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = request.headers['Origin']
        elif (url.find(request.headers['Host'])!= -1):
            response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = url
    return response
```


Hello dear reader! I have been trying to learn Flask and solve this issue(because I am working on a project with it). I've written a few hundred
lines of code in Flask over the past 2 years, but honestly I'm pretty bad at it and don't know the internal workings yet. So my goal with this
approach was to learn enough while not getting confused a lot. I am sharing my learnings on things which I have struggled inspired by 
[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/). Please let me know if there is any better approach
for this. Thanks for reading üôè.
