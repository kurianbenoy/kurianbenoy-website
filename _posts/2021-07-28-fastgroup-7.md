In week 7, we covered the second half of lesson 5 and started with lesson 6 on Other Computer Vision problems like Multi-Label classification.
We have covered so far almost 25% of the FastBook aka. Deep Learning for Coders.

Last week, I wrote about what is covered in rest of lesson 5. Some of the new things which Aman introduced was:

- The valley function in fastai, which is available in latest version to get the exact learning rate to be passed.

- More scheduling algorithms were mentioned like Torch optimizers, Classification algorithm.
