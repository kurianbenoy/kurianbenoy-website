Hey I thought about sharing a few lessons which I learned about finance:

Imagine you are given an offer: 

a) I will give you 10 lakhs over period of 5 years
b) I will give you 50 lakhs today

If you said option a like 90% of the people. You don't understand the concept of Inflation. The reason is simple, the 10 lakhs
of today will never be the same amount in 5 years, it's going to be even lesser.

Let me talk about the 7 baby steps created by Dave Ramsey:

1. Save $1,000 for your starter emergency fund.
2. Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt snowball.
3. Save 3–6 months of expenses in a fully funded emergency fund.
4. Invest 15% of your household income in retirement.
5. Save for your children’s college fund.
6. Pay off your home early.
7. Build wealth and give.
