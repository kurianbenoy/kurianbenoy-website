Last week I enrolled for the [live cohort of Deep Learning For Coders with fastai Course](https://itee.uq.edu.au/event/2022/practical-deep-learning-coders-uq-fastai)
which is going to be taken by Jeremy Howard. It's' a previlege at the same time, a dream come true moment for me, as a fastai student
who has taken fast.ai course from the year 2018.

I am blogging about the side projects which I am making, lesson recap notes in my [ML blog](https://kurianbenoy.com/ml-blog/). Do check that space in
coming days.
