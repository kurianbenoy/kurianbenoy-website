What if AI systems could count numbers?


So then the numbers will be pronounced as

1888 - Eighteen Eighty-Eight


1111 - Eleven Hundred Eleven,


No folks, AI is cooler. It's => Eleventeen Onety One


## Installation


`python -m pip install numbersai==0.0.1`


## Usage


```
>> from nosai.numbers import spell
>> spell(1111)
'Eleventeen Onety one'
```


## Technology used


This package is build based one of the [Rules of Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml)


*I.e. Rule #7*: Turn heuristics into features, or handle them externally.


We didn't require any complex models which was trained for ten thousand hours, all it needed was a few if loops.
