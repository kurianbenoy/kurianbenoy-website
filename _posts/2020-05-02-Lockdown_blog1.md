## What's prostate cancer?

The prostate and seminal vesicles are part of the male reproductive system. The prostate is about the size of a walnut and weighs about one ounce. The seminal vesicles are two much smaller paired glands. These glands are attached to each side of the prostate. Some have said that the seminal vesicles look like rabbit ears attached to the prostate. The prostate is below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the penis. This is why men with an enlarged prostate have difficulty urinating. It can disrupt the flow of urine from the bladder.

The main job of the prostate and seminal vesicles is to make fluid to bathe semen. During ejaculation, sperm is made in the testicles and then moves to the urethra. At the same time, fluid from the prostate and the seminal vesicles also moves into the urethra. This mixture of semen and fluid from the prostate and seminal vesicles forms the ejaculate that passes through the urethra and out of the penis.

When prostate cancer occurs, it starts in the prostate gland and occasionally spreads to the seminal vesicles.

In India alone: **1 million cases are reported per year**(more than the no of Covid-19 cases)

There are 2 growth stages of the prostate:

- Benign growths (like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): which don't invade tissues around them and can be removed slowly is not a threat to life.

- Malignant growths (prostate cancer): which can spread to other tissues like(such as the bladder or rectum), which even on removal can grow back is a threat to life.

## Symptoms

In its early stages, prostate cancer often has no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can be like those of an enlarged prostate or BPH. Prostate cancer can also cause symptoms unrelated to BPH. If you have urinary problems, talk with your healthcare provider about them.

Symptoms of prostate cancer can be:

* Dull pain in the lower pelvic area
* Frequent urinating
* Trouble urinating, pain, burning, or weak urine flow
* Blood in urine
* Painful ejaculation
* Pain in the lower back, hips or upper thighs
* Loss of appetite
* Loss of weight
* Bone pain

Recently I have been realising, how terribly badly I am coding in python. It's after nearly 3 years learning the
language I am realising this sad fact.No but I am not getting discouraged, I will be coding and thinking about using
correct datastructures and I am participating in 30 days of Mentoring challenge with Anand B Pillai, such a great mentor
to have who gives great tips to improve your code.

And this week I learned about CamelCase, Snakecase, pascalcase, Kebab case style of naming variable. For python, it's
always ideal to stick to snakecase while for languages like Swift it's better to use CamelCase.

And I have been kaggling a lot and disappointed a lot with my leaderboard score not getting improved, which is such a
disappointment. But I used up 20K rupees worth TPU credit for 2nd week in a row.

That's all thanks. I will try to write brief blogs daily during this quarantine period.
