I am pretty new to the field of software engineering and my journey as a developer has just begun. Yet in my short time, I have got to work with awesome developers both in open source space and in my workplace.
Technical architecture and Reusability
Some of the best developers when working in any project care not just about getting and satisfying requirements. They care about how various technical architecture should be build and has a good grasp of various technologies required for the successful execution of any program. The problem of building and choosing technical architecture can't be done by any automation software or language models. This is why it's so important to be good in it and build that skillset.
Another reason why technical architecture is important is to reduce technical debt(which is amount of software which you write can be useless later because of changing project requirements) . This is where we should try to build reusable software which can be build from the exact same project in very minimal time. So next time when you are building a project, if you are planning to hard code some project specific thing. Wait a minute and think how you can improve it further, and avoid tightly coupled dependencies.
Breadth wise knowledge of Technical stack
They care deeply about the various software required for building products. They have fundamental knowledge of why each technical stack is required for various programming purposes. This knowledge helps in process of designing systems in a way better way of developing product with good architecture and care about reusability.
Also it's very important to know the depth of programming language. As it recommended to learn the language you use in work in-depth, to very bottom in [this advice by Georgely Orsz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-to-myself-when-starting-as-a-software-developer/).
Personally, I need to work gaining more depth on python like the async function, generators, other logics for more side project in coming days.
GET the Shit Done
I remember this quote hiring rounds from one of prominent companies which is a leading social media for working professionals:
It's very important we as programmers to realise and achieve the task required for the product. There may be hard task which may seem tedious and difficult at first. But start working on it early and don't make it slip every time.
