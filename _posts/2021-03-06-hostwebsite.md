I am discussing in this article how to host a self domain with Github:



1. Buy a domain name. I got mine from bigrock.in, while there are sites like google domains, hover, GoDaddy etc. A domain costs about Rs 500-1000 if you are using a long name with a suffix .com, .in etc
2. Enter your domain name in Github pages, and enforce HTTPS for our custom domain. Thanks to let's encrypt which is providing HTTPS
3. Create an A record and CNAME in your DNS management system in your domain name and set the associated values. Check the below link for settings:

[Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

4. Tada, your site is hosted like mine - https://kurianbenoy.com/
