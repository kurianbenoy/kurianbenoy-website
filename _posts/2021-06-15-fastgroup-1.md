I am sharing a few advice shared by Jeremy in his [Lesson-0] and book:

- Commit to complete the course

- The actual learning of the book, involves the following components usually:

  * Watching lecture/book
  * Running notebook and Experimentation
  * Reproduce Results
  * Working on a different dataset

- Always start with clean version of notebook and see what all you remember of the existing lessons, and understand what 
it is doing

- Always ask question, and don't be afraid of yourself to expose yourself to world(advise by Aman Arora)

Let me share a few list of things I learned over the period, as part of my exploration:

1. fastai fine_tune() method under the hood is for training simultaneously. It runs twice, when it's being passed once. If you look at some of the datasets
2. nbdev what it is ? Nicely formatted docs
3. Then talk about using ?? and function definitions. Looking more into explore more into docs
4. Talk about opening datasets and looking into results and fine tuning things
5. DuckDuckgo image creation process, bug and fixing it.
6. Talk about my development server using Google Colabs and Kaggle GPUs. Also talk about the option to use localhost for development purpose
