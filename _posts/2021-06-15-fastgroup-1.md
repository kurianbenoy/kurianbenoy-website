I am sharing a few advice shared by Jeremy in his [Lesson-0] and book:

- Commit to complete the course
- The actual learning of the book, involves the following components usually:

  * Watching lecture/book
  * Running notebook
  * Doing experimentation
  * Working on a different dataset

- Always start with clean version of notebook and see what all you remember of the existing lessons, and understand what 
it is doing

- Always ask question, and don't be afraid of yourself to expose yourself to world(advise by Aman Arora)
