// The post idea is to take through the entire thought process required when building a spam classifier. Like how to
collect data, how do you decide words which are spam, then talk about modelling part. Deploying the application etc.


// lot more things to learn before build a classifier
talk about bloom filter
=> It basically a DB with hashing. You hash the input keys and if there is a collision, store the result in a DB


//Inspiration: Compile inc interview
CompileInc placement came and my resume did stand out. In the call with CEO were banged me by asking questions on what is happening when you enter compile.com(DNS and even more things), then to removing duplicate lines from my spam filter, to asking how will I collect the data for building a spam classifier(non labelled data), or doing crowd-sourcing route. Data structure of data collection(fucking hell) and about building initial prototype of my spam classifier.
