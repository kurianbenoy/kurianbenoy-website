talk about bloom filter

CompileInc placement came and my resume did stand out. In the call with CEO were banged me by asking questions on what is happening when you enter compile.com(DNS and even more things), then to removing duplicate lines from my spam filter, to asking how will I collect the data for building a spam classifier(non labelled data), or doing crowd-sourcing route. Data structure of data collection(fucking hell) and about building initial prototype of my spam classifier.
