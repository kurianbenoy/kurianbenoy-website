So, let's start another week of learning logs from session 5:

- We are using the same cnn_learner for Muli-label image classification

## Multi-Image Classification Algorithm(Why are we using binary cross entropy loss?)

- Why are we using BCE Loss, instead of cross entropy?
- The question of loss function, which is used to optimise our model is very critical
- We can't use Cross Entropy loss, why according to book:

If you forgot, what is cross entropy loss I highly recommend to check [Ravi Mishra's blogpost on Understanding Cross Entropy](https://ravimashru.dev/blog/2021-07-18-understanding-cross-entropy-loss/)
