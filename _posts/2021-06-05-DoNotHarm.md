[![Doctor Attacked](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24592806/120882009-a53e1980-c5f2-11eb-8b61-24ff9cd4bd48.png)](https://youtu.be/K6yrsdGP0bA)

The above video shows how a Junior Doctor has been attacked in Assam, India. It's very unfortunate to see doctors,
attacked like this and we have seen even things worse than this happen to doctors. Generally most of doctors in
the critical care units who work are usually Junior Doctors, who have to work long hours to get the initial experience. 
Yet these Junior doctors are usually at the receiving ends of the blows from relatives of deceased people in most of the cases.

The human body is too complex to understand in it’s entirety, but doctors still take an oath to do no harm. New viruses can
comes with lot of new novelty, yet doctors still adhere to there oath of doing no harm.

So let me share some notes from Uncle Bob's book on Clean Coder:


## First, Do No Harm

> So how do we take responsibility? There are some principles. Drawing from the Hippocratic oath may seem arrogant, but what better source is there? And, indeed, doesn’t it make sense that the first responsibility, and first goal, of an aspiring professional is to use his or her powers for good? What harm can a software developer do? From a purely software point of view, he or she can do harm to both the function and structure of the software. We’ll explore how to avoid doing just that.

### Do No Harm to Function
Clearly, we want our software to work. Indeed, most of us are programmers today because we got something to work once and we want that feeling again. But we aren’t the only ones who want the software to work. Our customers and employers want it to work too. Indeed, they are paying us to create software that works just the way they want it to. We harm the function of our software when we create bugs. Therefore, in order to be professional, we must not create bugs. “But wait!” I hear you say. “That’s not reasonable. Software is too complex to create without bugs.

Of course you are right. Software is too complex to create without bugs. Unfortunately that doesn’t let you off the hook. The human body is too complex to understand in it’s entirety, but doctors still take an oath to do no harm. If they don’t take themselves off a hook like that, how can we? “Are you telling us we must be perfect?” Do I hear you object? No, I’m telling you that you must be responsible for your imperfections. The fact that bugs will certainly occur in your code does not mean you aren’t responsible for them. The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren’t responsible for the imperfection. It is the lot of a professional to be accountable for errors even though errors are virtually certain. So, my aspiring professional, the first thing you must practice is apologizing. Apologies are necessary, but insufficient. You cannot simply keep making the same errors over and over. As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero. It won’t ever get to zero, but it is your responsibility to get as close as possible to it.
