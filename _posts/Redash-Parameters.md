Redash used in the parameters for analytics.
It is very helpful feature for giving a interactive nature for queries, instead of just saying stats based on certain predefined variables,
parameters allow users to run queries for insights on months, time ranges or values they are interested in. Redash queries support it for both SQL,
mongodb queries.

- eg
- 7 types of queries

- filter is like select list in a html form, where we can select the values corresponding to potential values in the row associated with it
- Not widely usely, but is helpful

Datasette recently implemented this parameter feature which is super useful, which is something I have been wanting to explore for a long time now
