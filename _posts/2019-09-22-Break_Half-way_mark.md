Data Science Network(DSNet) organised a Kaggle competition as part of Kaggle days workshop. This competition will be a
beginner friendly competition aimed at helping you get started with kaggle. Special recognition and awards will be
granted to those who create useful and healthy discussions and kernels.

I created a beginner friendly kernel, which gave good introduction to get a Decent score in this competition with [this
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/kurianbenoy/break-half-way-mark-0-52-leaderboard-score).

I am just 1 bronze medal away from being a Kaggle Expert in Kernels. I have two ideas for new kernels:

- FastAI code explained for Kannada MNIST
- DVC for Cats vs Dogs problem
