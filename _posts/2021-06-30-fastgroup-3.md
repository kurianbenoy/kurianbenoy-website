## Recap of Week 3

- Aman decided to cover only the Chapter 2 during the session.
- As a group, Aman asked all of us to check out the  questionnares in Chapter. Always asks your questions in group.
- Dataloaders is something which passes the function one by one is called function. Fastai has train dataloader and validation dataloader

- I was immediately curious about what to do for test dataset as well. The full discussion thread can be [found in this link](https://wandb.ai/aarora/discussions/Fastbook-Reading-Group-Week-3--Vmlldzo3OTMwODk).

- Generally for any model, there are two terms. One is X which called independent variable and Y which is label to predict is called dependent variable.
- Let's dive deep into fastbooks
 1. Get dependent & independent variables
2. Get image files
3. Splitters(train and valid dataset)
get-parent-label, it's just finding parent folder and getting it's folder
Splitter is basically splitting to validation and train images. It helps me a lot (answered personally for me)

- There are lot of data augmentation techniques. In the book we discussed methods like padding images, Random Resized Crop, Resize etc. 
Since there is a lot of black spaced broders,padding methods are not really good. All these methods are suboptimal way of doing things.
- According to book, Random Resized Crop, it's way better that any other images. It doesn't see the
 full images in each pass. Yet over a span of moving through multiple epochs, it sees the entire images
- In ImageDataLoaders from-name-func, internally calling Dataloaders.
- I am just attaching the full video of the session.

The homework for this week is to have an online working version of the app to be demoed to people. [Aman](https://amaarora.github.io/) has said those 
who do not complete the assignment, need not even come to the sessions.

Now let me share some of my learning this week:

- I started working on creating a tree classifier, which classifies based on the images what species of tree it is.
- Online Application created: [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kurianbenoy/Tree-Classifier/HEAD?filepath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Ftree-classifier-app.ipynb)
- Started working on creating a VUEJS + Flask based Image classifier. It's being inspired by [this blogpost](https://fullstackwithpr.hashnode.dev/the-bear-classifier-fastai-meets-angular)
- I stumbled upon a shortcut key in Jupyter, that is on pressing `Shift + Tab` together you can seen the function definition
