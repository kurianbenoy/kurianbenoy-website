Hey Kurian in future,

1. Don't marry any technologies, and don't just be associated to any particular field, programming language. Remember about the time your username was `django_master` and luckily getting selected to first Pycon talk changed everything.
2. Always respect & care parents & elders
3. Remember everything is just Maya Maya (just pointless) as stated by wisest of wise person.
4. When you are thinking goosebumps or feel proud of something, remember that sooner or later there is a low point coming.
5. Always look back to your past and be grateful for everything. Also look at your core and remember where you started.

Signing off,
Kurian
