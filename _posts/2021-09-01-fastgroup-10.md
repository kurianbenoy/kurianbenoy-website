The first section covered about filters. We used kernel 
which is a little matrix that is applied to the image which
is usually used as a feature engineering step.

We have defined various version of filters, which can
be used to extract features from the image like filters based on the 
top_edge:

top_edge = tensor([[-1, -1, -1],
                    [0, 0, 0],
                    [1, 1, 1]]).float()

THe above diagrams shows how we are applying the various filters
in edges of an image.

Then we are looking at the applying convolutions in pytorch.
The edges of each shape of 28*28 images when applied to a filter
are returning 64 batches of 4 filters and height and weight is 26*26
as it loses 2 pixels.
