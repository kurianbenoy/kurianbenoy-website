I had taken my longest vacation from work in past week for four days.
Yet looking forward to the vacation was and planning for it was
really interesting at the same time hectic. My initial plan was to visit
a old palace ie Padmnapuram palace in Thuckalay, Tamil Naidu.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out.

So I pivoted my plan to stay in any hotel/resort. Before telling
about the experience let me tell, what motivated me to take my vacation
at the first place. It was an article by Randy Au, who told [why
taking vacation is important with a realistic angle](https://counting.substack.com/p/vacation-is-the-power-say-no-by-not).
In the article the lessons on why we are not important to any organization and planning
aspect is well covered. [Randy Au answered my question](https://twitter.com/Randy_Au/status/1494339578567663631)
on how to treat travelling as a hobby.

I applied for four days of leave in advance before planning where
I am going to plan. Then I started my journey of hunting the perfect
place to stay. After almost 20+ hotel enquiries and also trying to
accomodate everyone in my family to cmome with me. Unfortunately
not everyone in my family was willing to come except my mother.
After a lot of searching we decided to book the hotel at Mango Meadows
and set aside one day to travel with my family in
Ernakulam(with a buffet dinner).

Mango meadows resort is an excellent place and is an agricultural themed
park. The best experience was swimming in pay pool, then cycling followed by 
bumpy ride in london metro. Staff were excellent and 5 stars review for
the resort.

So all the travelling was worth it and the next day back at work I had lot of messages
and 70+ emails to answer. This proved everything Randy said, and slowly one day I will
also get better at vacationing. Also we started planning for our next big trip to Armenia which
will materialize one day hopefully.
