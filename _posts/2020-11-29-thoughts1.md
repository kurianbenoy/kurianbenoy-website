# DRAFT

Today I listened to one of the podcast episode in Building a career in Datascience podcast. According to them there are
four career paths to get the skills for being a Datascientist. They are:

a) Getting Master/ Datascience Specialisation degrees
b) Bootcamps
c) Learning with work
d) Self learning

In India recently there have been lot of new Data science degrees and course available. It may obviously be due to
lot of the hype that is happening in the industry right now. Some of the degree programs right now available are:

1. BITS course for working integrated learning programs

Some of the course are MTECH in Data Science and Software system. The course fee is approx: Rs 2.4 Lakhs for 2 year course

2. IIIT Kottayam courses

Syllabus: https://www.iiitkottayam.ac.in/data/pdf/rev_mtech_curriculam.pdf

Most of these course have some mix of Computer Science and Statistics degree. Most of the faculties may not have that much hands on 
knowledge. It wouldn't be very helpful to have a degree for datascience just because it is something good to have.

One of greatest perks of taking a higher degree is the amount of motivation and self control you have over your work generally.


c) Learning with work is an awesome experience too
