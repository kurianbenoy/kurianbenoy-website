## Recap of Week 4

- The topic covered for this week was Going Deeper Into Computer Vision w/ MNIST Digit Classifier
- Pixels are the foundation of images, and we are using MNIST dataset to explore Deep learning
- We are using `URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE`, which is a sample of images of 3 and 7. There is another dataset MNIST containing handwritten images `from digits 0-9`.
- In computer everything is an array
- Lot of wonderful ideas were discuss how to classify images in the [discussion thread](https://wandb.me/fastbook-4) like classifying number based “surface % of this square of background that is covered by number”.
-  We decided to go with Pixel similarity, that is to find average value for every pixels of 3s and 7s. Then the two group averages define what is the ideal 3 and ideal 7
- The first difference we are going to see, is what is the difference b/w tensor and array. Array is terminology in numpy and tensor for pythorch
- rank is the number of axes or dimensions in a tensor
- shape is the size of each axis of a tensor
