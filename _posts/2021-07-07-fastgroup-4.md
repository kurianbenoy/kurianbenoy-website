## Recap of Week 4

- The topic covered for this week was Going Deeper Into Computer Vision w/ MNIST Digit Classifier
- Pixels are the foundation of images, and we are using MNIST dataset to explore Deep learning
- We are using `URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE`, which is a sample of images of 3 and 7. There is another dataset MNIST containing handwritten images `from digits 0-9`.
- In computer everything is an array
- Lot of wonderful ideas were discuss how to classify images in the [discussion thread](https://wandb.me/fastbook-4) like classifying number based “surface % of this square of background that is covered by number”.
-  We decided to go with Pixel similarity, that is to find average value for every pixels of 3s and 7s. Then the two group averages define what is the ideal 3 and ideal 7
- The first difference we are going to see, is what is the difference b/w tensor and array. Array is terminology in numpy and tensor for pythorch
- rank is the number of axes or dimensions in a tensor
- shape is the size of each axis of a tensor
- Now for our ML model, to distinguish between images of 3 and 7. What it does is basically, check if compare our mean images of 3 and 7 obtained by stacking images and finding mean. Then you compare the new image and find difference between mean of 3 and 7. As Aman pointed out, when subtracting between two unlike quantities there is a possibility to cancel out.

- So calculate with absolute value to find difference(L1 loss)
- Else calculate by finding difference and then sqaruing(L2 loss- rmse loss)
- Major difference b/w Pytorch and Numpy is:
a) Pytorch works on GPU and Numpy is working on CPU
b) Pytorch can automatically calculate gradients
- Computing Metrics using broadcasting. Broadcasting is automatic filling of lists to match matrix shape
-
