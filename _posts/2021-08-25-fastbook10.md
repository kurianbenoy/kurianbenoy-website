In Deep Learning frameworks, the idea of pandas cross tab to represent the latent factors of a matrix is not
present. To represent our movies like in the below diagram:



```
foo = pd.Categorical(['a', 'b'], categories=['a', 'b', 'c'])
bar = pd.Categorical(['d', 'e'], categories=['d', 'e', 'f'])
>pd.crosstab(foo, bar, dropna=False)
col_0  d  e  f
row_0
a      1  0  0
b      0  1  0
c      0  0  0
```

In frameworks like Pytorch, multiplying by a one-hot encoded matrix using the computational shortcut
that it can be implemented by simply indexing directly. This is quite a fancy word for a very simple
concept. The thing that you can multiply the one hot-encoded matrix by (or using a computational shortcut
index into directly) is called Embedding matrix.
