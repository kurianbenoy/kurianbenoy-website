I have been shopping quite regularly with various online companies for many years. Yet in the past few months, I feel I got cheated twice. Things are all good about online shopping when you get discounts, products arrive on time with no damage etc but there is a chance for something bad as well. It's usual to have products being delivered slowly and again rescheduled to some other cases. 

Then there are cases where you expected a product to be good in shape, yet when it arrives the product won't be of expected quality and feature. The only thing you can usually do is ask the product to be returned in the same shape again or being offered money in some wallet.  None of these platforms has a direct person like managers with authority or formal email id to reach out.  Instead there are customer care centres which is semi-automated and has employees who are clueless and don't know how to fix issues.

That is why it's better to go to some real shops to buy things you want and can reach out to them directly in case of disputes or refunds. It is in such interactions only you realise the value of money. You can save more money rather than purchasing unwanted things because of some algorithms optimise for that.  

My best shopping experiences were because of the people whom I interacted rather than the things I bought. I once spend Rs 100 to buy 4 Kgs of Green beans, Lady's finger from a shopkeeper who told me the hardship of his business and helped me keep things in my scooter.  I am longing for more such encounters and more such experiences, that's why I am going to avoid online shopping from now. Let's see how it goes and will update if anything changes in the way.
