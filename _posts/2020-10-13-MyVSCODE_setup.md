It's 1AM in the morning, and I am about to call it for the night. I realize if I don't write this piece, it's never going 
to be in my blog ever. We all know Inspiration dies!

I have used a lot of Editors from trying out Atom, sublime text, then moving away from these IDEs to text based terminal based
IDEs in linux like first vim, then to emacs world, then back again to VIM. Yet when writing code, I felt I was missing code completion which is something
very important. That's when I turned to visual studio code. So far my usage experience is so far great and I am planning to continue only using 
VSCODE for atleast the next 6 months.

My current VSCode setup looks like this:

I use a **Default Light** colour scheme. I use the following extensions to make my life easier:

- Pylance
- Python
- Remote WSl
- YAML
- Anaconda extension pack(cause I now use conda as my package manager)

I always love to have my line highlighted with the below settings change:

```
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {

        "editor.lineHighlightBackground": "#add8e6"
      }
}
```

That's all for now. I will update this article if I make any more changes
