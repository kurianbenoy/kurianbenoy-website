## KTU - startup

- KTU came something like with lot of new ideas like being of MIT level
from Kerala. 
- 46 subjects, 15 labs etc and lot more internals. The bachelors degree is finally completed.
- One of the best things about KTU in my opinion is the changes which it introduced to fast track result publication
  after each semester(usually results came after 1 months) and the new set of innovation it brought together. Yet one of
  the issues with KTU which I have found was it has not stand to it's original set of innovations like year back policy,
  policy to have students taking a break in between, introduction of Python etc. I am really angry at KTU removing Python from 1st semester,
  and all our juniors wouldn't enjoy that now. If I wouldn't
  have learnt Python in college in the first semester, my tech journey would not be this way.

I always believed college was a great differenciator for me. The college MEC has been 
so wonderful for me. The seniors and juniors have helped me mould me a lot. 
The best thing about Model Engineering College was there was no such junior senior 
divide. I met some of the most talented seniors like Prince chettai, Siva, Abhijit,
Nikitha Mallya chechi during my time at MEC. These seniors actually broadened my
dreams a lot with various interactions with them. Even my class was filled with lot
of prodigies from people like Adarsh S, Jithin, Shahul, Joel, Anusree, Meenakshi and 
many more. The person with whom I have travelled most is obiviously Joel, he is a chill
and one of the best person I have met ever.

College is not about academics, it's about the peer group in the college. Once you go to college it enlarges your
dreams, creates new friends, makes you travel to places where you could never imagine before you actually reach there.
Academics and attendance are not always necessary
